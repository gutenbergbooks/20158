<p>The source code for this HTML page contains only Latin-1 characters, but
it directs the browser to display some special characters. The original
work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are
represented here as Greek letters, for example
<span title="Oi~moi">&#927;&#8150;&#956;&#959;&#953;</span>.
If the mouse is held still over such phrases, a transliteration in Beta-code pops up.
Aside from Greek letters, the only special characters displayed are a few
letters e and i with a breve or macron.
Two special characters that are not supported by Unicode
are displayed in bracket notation: [=N][=C] stands for N and C with
heavy macrons.</p>

<p>An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
are indicated by small raised keys in brackets; these are links to the
footnote's text. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers (e.g. [17],
[221]) are informational. Any text in square brackets is the work of
editor E.H. Coleridge. Unbracketed note text is by Byron himself.
Footnotes indexed with
letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) document variant forms of the text from
manuscripts and other sources.</p>

<p>In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each section,
and have been numbered consecutively throughout.</p>

<p>Navigation aids are provided as follows. Page numbers are displayed at
the right edge of the window. To jump directly to page <i>nn</i>, append
#Page_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.
To jump directly to the text of footnote <i>xx</i>, either search for [<i>xx</i>]
or append #Footnote_<i>xx</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>Within the blocks of footnotes, numbers in braces such as {321}
represent the page number on which following notes originally appeared.
These numbers are also preserved as HTML anchors of the form Note_321.
To find notes originally printed on page <i>nn</i>, either search
for the string {<i>nn</i>} or append #Note_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>The following corrections were made in the course of
transcribing the original text: On <a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>
the premiere date for <i>Manfred</i>
was corrected from "1384" to "1834" and the spelling of
"Tschaikowsky" was corrected from "Tschairowsky."
Although the text of a List of Illustrations is included in this etext,
the illustrations themselves were not available.

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> poems included in this volume consist of thirteen
longer or more important works, written at various
periods between June, 1816, and October, 1821; of eight
occasional pieces (<i>Poems of July-September</i>, 1816),
written in 1816; and of another collection of occasional
pieces (<i>Poems</i> 1816-1823), written at intervals between
November, 1816, and September, 1823. Of this second
group of minor poems five are now printed and published
for the first time.</p>

<p>The volume is not co-extensive with the work of the
period. The third and fourth cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i>
(1816-1817), the first five cantos of <i>Don Juan</i> (1818,
1819, 1820), <i>Sardanapalus</i>, <i>The Two Foscari</i>, <i>Cain</i>, and
<i>Heaven and Earth</i> (1821), form parts of other volumes,
but, in spite of these notable exceptions, the fourth
volume contains the work of the poet's maturity, which
is and must ever remain famous. Byron was not content
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
to write on one kind of subject, or to confine
himself to one branch or species of poetry. He tracked
the footsteps now of this master poet, now of another,
far outstripping some of his models; soon spent in the
pursuit of others. Even in his own lifetime, and in the
heyday of his fame, his friendliest critics, who applauded
him to the echo, perceived that the "manifold motions"
of his versatile and unsleeping talent were not always
sanctioned or blessed by his genius. Hence the unevenness
of his work, the different values of this or that
poem. But, even so, in width of compass, in variety of
style, and in measure of success, his achievement was
unparalleled. Take such poems as <i>Manfred</i> or <i>Mazeppa</i>,
which have left their mark on the literature of Europe;
as <i>Beppo</i>, the <i>avant courrier</i> of <i>Don Juan</i>, or the
"inimitable" <i>Vision of Judgment</i>, which the "hungry
generations" have not trodden down or despoiled of
its freshness. Not one of these poems suggests or
resembles the other, but each has its crowd of associations,
a history and almost a literature of its own.</p>

<p>The whole of this volume was written on foreign soil,
in Switzerland or Italy, and, putting aside <i>The Dream</i>,
<i>The Monody on the Death of Sheridan</i>, <i>The Irish Avatar</i>,
and <i>The Blues</i>, the places, the persons and events, the
<i>mat&eacute;riel</i> of the volume as a whole, to say nothing of
the style and metre of the poems, are derived from the
history and the literature of Switzerland and Southern
Europe. An unwilling, at times a vindictive exile, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>did more than any other poet or writer of his age to
familiarize his own countrymen with the scenery, the art
and letters of the Continent, and, conversely, to make
the existence of English literature, or, at least, the
writings of one Englishman, known to Frenchmen and
Italians; to the Teuton and the Slav. If he "taught us
little" as prophet or moralist; as a guide to knowledge;
as an educator of the general reader&mdash;"your British
blackguard," as he was pleased to call him&mdash;his teaching
and influence were "in widest commonalty spread."</p>

<p>Questions with regard to his personality, his morals,
his theological opinions, his qualifications as an artist,
his grammar, his technique, and so forth, have, perhaps
inevitably, absorbed the attention of friend and foe, and
the one point on which all might agree has been overlooked,
namely, the fact that he taught us a great deal
which it is desirable and agreeable to know&mdash;which has
passed into common knowledge through the medium
of his poetry. It is true that he wrote his plays and
poems at lightning speed, and that if he was at pains to
correct some obvious blunders, he expended but little
labour on picking his phrases or polishing his lines; but
it is also true that he read widely and studied diligently,
in order to prepare himself for an outpouring of verse,
and that so far from being a superficial observer or
inaccurate recorder, his authority is worth quoting in
questions of fact and points of detail.</p>

<p>The appreciation of poetry is a matter of taste, and
still more of temperament. Readers cannot be coerced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
into admiration, or scolded into disapproval and contempt.
But if they are willing or can be persuaded to
read with some particularity and attention the writings
of the illustrious dead, not entirely as partisans, or with
the view to dethroning other "Monarchs of Parnassus,"
they will divine the secret of their fame, and will
understand, perhaps recover, the "first rapture" of
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Byron sneered and carped at Southey as a "scribbler
of all works." He was himself a reader of all works,
and without some measure of book-learning and not a
little research the force and significance of his various
numbers are weakened or obliterated.</p>

<p>It is with the hope of supplying this modicum of
book-learning that the Introductions and notes in this
and other volumes have been compiled.</p>

<p>I desire to acknowledge, with thanks, the courteous
response of Mons. J. Capr&eacute;, Commandant of the Castle
of Chillon, to a letter of inquiry with regard to the
"Souterrains de Chillon."</p>

<p>I have to express my gratitude to Sir Henry Irving,
to Mr. Joseph Knight, and to Mr. F. E. Taylor, for
valuable information concerning the stage representation
of <i>Manfred</i> and <i>Marino Faliero</i>.</p>

<p>I am deeply indebted to Dr. Richard Garnett, C.B.,
and to my friend, Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, for assistance
in many important particulars during the construction of
the volume.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>I must also record my thanks to Mr. Oscar Browning,
Mr. Josceline Courtenay, and other correspondents, for
information and assistance in points of difficulty.</p>

<p>I have consulted and derived valuable information
from the following works: <i>The Prisoner of Chillon</i>, etc.,
by the late Professor K&ouml;lbing; <i>Mazeppa</i>, by Dr.
Englaender; <i>Marino Faliero avanti il Dogado</i> and <i>La
Congiura</i> (published in the <i>Nuovo Archivio Veneto</i>), by
Signor Vittorio Lazzarino; and <i>Selections from the Poetry
of Lord Byron</i>, by Dr. F. I. Carpenter of Chicago, U.S.A.</p>

<p>I take the opportunity of expressing my acknowledgments
to Miss K. Schlesinger, Miss De Alberti, and to
Signor F. Bianco, for their able and zealous services in
the preparation of portions of the volume.</p>

<p>On behalf of the publisher I beg to acknowledge the
kindness of Captain the Hon. F. L. King Noel, in
sanctioning the examination and collation of the MS. of
<i>Beppo</i>, now in his possession; and of Mrs. Horace
Pym of Foxwold Chace, for permitting the portrait of
Sheridan by Sir Joshua Reynolds to be reproduced
for this volume.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE PRISONER OF CHILLON</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>


<p>The <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>, says Moore (<i>Life</i>, p. 320), was
written at Ouchy, near Lausanne, where Byron and Shelley
"were detained two days in a small inn [H&ocirc;tel de l'Ancre,
now d'Angleterre] by the weather." Byron's letter to Murray,
dated June 27 (but? 28), 1816, does not precisely tally with
Shelley's journal contained in a letter to Peacock, July 12,
1816 (<i>Prose Works of P. B. Shelley</i>, 1880, ii. 171, <i>sq.</i>);
but, if Shelley's first date, June 23, is correct, it follows that the
two poets visited the Castle of Chillon on Wednesday, June 26,
reached Ouchy on Thursday, June 27, and began their
homeward voyage on Saturday, June 29 (Shelley misdates it
June 30). On this reckoning the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i> was
begun and finished between Thursday, June 27, and Saturday,
June 29, 1816. Whenever or wherever begun, it was completed
by July 10 (see <i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i.
364), and was ready for transmission to England by July 25.
The MS., in Claire's handwriting, was placed in Murray's
hands on October 11, and the poem, with seven others, was
published December 5, 1816.</p>

<p>In a final note to the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i> (First Edition,
1816, p. 59), Byron confesses that when "the foregoing poem
was composed he knew too little of the history of Bonnivard
to do justice to his courage and virtues," and appends as a
note to the "Sonnet on Chillon," "some account of his
life ... furnished by the kindness of a citizen of that
Republic," i.e. Geneva. The note, which is now entitled
"Advertisement," is taken bodily from the pages of a work
published in 1786 by the Swiss naturalist, Jean Senebier,
who died in 1809. It was not Byron's way to invent imaginary
authorities, but rather to give his references with some
pride and particularity, and it is possible that this
unacknowledged and hitherto unverified "account" was supplied by
some literary acquaintance, who failed to explain that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
information was common property. Be that as it may, Senebier's
prose is in some respects as unhistorical as Byron's
verse, and stands in need of some corrections and additions.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Bonivard (there is no contemporary authority for
"Bonnivard") was born in 1493. In early youth (1510) he
became by inheritance Prior of St. Victor, a monastery outside
the walls of Geneva, and on reaching manhood (1514)
he accepted the office and the benefice, "la dignit&eacute; eccl&eacute;siastique
de Prieur et de la Seigneurie temporelle de St.
Victor." A lover of independence, a child of the later
Renaissance, in a word, a Genevese, he threw in his lot
with a band of ardent reformers and patriots, who were
conspiring to shake off the yoke of Duke Charles III. of
Savoy, and convert the city into a republic. Here is his
own testimony: "D&egrave;s que j'eus commenc&eacute; de lire l'histoire
des nations, je me sentis entrain&eacute; par un go&ucirc;t prononc&eacute; pour
les R&eacute;publiques dont j'&eacute;pousai toujours les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts." Hence,
in a great measure, the unrelenting enmity of the duke, who
not only ousted him from his priory, but caused him to be
shut up for two years at Grol&eacute;e, Gex, and Belley, and again,
after he had been liberated on a second occasion, ordered
him, a safe conduct notwithstanding, to be seized and confined
in the Castle of Chillon. Here he remained from
1530 to February 1, 1536, when he was released by the
Bernese.</p>

<p>For the first two years he was lodged in a room near the
governor's quarters, and was fairly comfortable; but a day
came when the duke paid a visit to Chillon; and "then," he
writes, "the captain thrust me into a cell lower than the lake,
where I lived four years. I know not whether he did it by
the duke's orders or of his own accord; but sure it is that
I had so much leisure for walking, that I wore in the rock
which was the pavement a track or little path, as it had been
made with a hammer" (<i>Chroniques des Ligues</i> de Stumpf,
addition de Bonivard).</p>

<p>After he had been liberated, "par la grace de Dieu
donnee a Mess<span class="sup">rs</span> de Berne," he returned to Geneva, and was
made a member of the Council of the State, and awarded
a house and a pension of two hundred crowns a year. A
long life was before him, which he proceeded to spend in
characteristic fashion, finely and honourably as scholar,
author, and reformer, but with little self-regard or self-respect
as a private citizen. He was married no less than four times,
and not one of these alliances was altogether satisfactory
or creditable. Determined "to warm both hands before
the fire of life," he was prone to ignore the prejudices and
even the decencies of his fellow-citizens, now incurring their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
displeasure, and now again, as one who had greatly testified
for truth and freedom, being taken back into favour and
forgiven. There was a deal of human nature in Bonivard,
with the result that, at times, conduct fell short of pretension
and principle. Estimates of his character differ widely.
From the standpoint of Catholic orthodoxy, "C'&eacute;tait un fort
mauvais sujet et un plus mauvais pr&ecirc;tre;" and even his
captivity, infamous as it was, "ne peut rendre Bonivard
int&eacute;ressant" (<i>Notices G&eacute;n&eacute;alogiques sur les Famillies Genevoises</i>,
par J. A. Galiffe, 1836, iii. 67, sq.); whilst an advocate
and champion, the author of the <i>Preface</i> to <i>Les Chroniques
de Gen&egrave;ve</i> par Fran&ccedil;ois de Bonnivard, 1831, tom. i. pt. i.
p. xli., avows that "aucun homme n'a fait preuve d'un plus
beau caract&egrave;re, d'un plus parfait d&eacute;sint&eacute;ressement que
l'illustre Prieur de St. Victor." Like other great men, he
may have been guilty of "quelques &eacute;garemens du coeur,
quelques concessions passag&egrave;res aux d&eacute;vices des sens," but
"Peu importe &agrave; la post&eacute;rit&eacute; les irr&eacute;gularit&eacute;s de leur vie
priv&eacute;e" (p. xlviii.).</p>

<p>But whatever may be the final verdict with regard to the
morals, there can be no question as to the intellectual powers
of the "Prisoner of Chillon." The publication of various
MS. tracts, e.g. <i>Advis et Devis de l'ancienne et nouvelle
Police de Gen&egrave;ve</i>, 1865; <i>Advis et Devis des Lengnes</i>, etc.,
1865, which were edited by the late J. J. Chaponni&egrave;re, and,
after his death, by M. Gustave Revilliod, has placed his reputation
as historian, satirist, philosopher, beyond doubt or
cavil. One quotation must suffice. He is contrasting the
Protestants with the Catholics (<i>Advis et Devis de la Source
de Lidolatrie</i>, Geneva, 1856, p. 159): "Et nous disons que
les prebstres rongent les mortz et est vray; mais nous faisons
bien pys, car nous rongeons les vifz. Quel profit revient aux
paveures du dommage des prebstres? Nous nous ventons
touttes les deux parties de prescher Christ cruciffie et disons
vray, car nous le laissons cruciffie et nud en l'arbre de la
croix, et jouons a beaux dez au pied dicelle croix, pour
scavoir qui haura sa robe."</p>

<p><i>The Prisoner of Chillon</i> was reviewed (together with the
Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>) by Sir Walter Scott
(<i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. xxxi., October, 1816), and by Jeffrey
(<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, No. liv., December, 1816).</p>

<p>With the exception of the <i>Eclectic</i> (March, 1817, N.S.,
vol. vii. pp. 298-304), the lesser reviews were unfavourable.
For instance, the <i>Critical Review</i> (December, 1816, Series
V. vol. iv. pp. 567-581) detected the direct but unacknowledged
influence of Wordsworth on thought and style;
and the <i>Portfolio</i> (No. vi. pp. 121-128), in an elaborate skit,
entitled "Literary Frauds," assumed, and affected to prove,
that the entire poem was a forgery, and belonged to the same
category as <i>The Right Honourable Lord Byron's Pilgrimage
to the Holy Land, etc.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> this poem<a name="FNanchor_a" id="FNanchor_a"></a><a href="#Footnote_a" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
was composed, I was not sufficiently
aware of the history of Bonnivard, or I should have
endeavoured to dignify the subject by an attempt to
celebrate his courage and his virtues. With some account
of his life I have been furnished, by the kindness of a
citizen of that republic, which is still proud of the memory
of a man worthy of the best age of ancient freedom:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fran&ccedil;ois De Bonnivard, fils de Louis De Bonnivard,
originaire de Seyssel et Seigneur de Lunes, naquit en
1496. Il fit ses &eacute;tudes &agrave; Turin: en 1510 Jean Aim&eacute; de
Bonnivard, son oncle, lui r&eacute;signa le Prieur&eacute; de St. Victor,
qui aboutissoit aux murs de Gen&egrave;ve, et qui formait un
b&eacute;n&eacute;fice consid&eacute;rable....</p>

<p>"Ce grand homme&mdash;(Bonnivard m&eacute;rite ce litre par la
force de son &acirc;me, la droiture de son coeur, la noblesse
de ses intentions, la sagesse de ses conseils, le courage de
ses d&eacute;marches, l'&eacute;tendue de ses connaissances, et la
vivacit&eacute; de son esprit),&mdash;ce grand homme, qui excitera
l'admiration de tous ceux qu'une vertu h&eacute;ro&iuml;que peut
encore &eacute;mouvoir, inspirera encore la plus vive reconnaissance
dans les coeurs des Genevois qui aiment Gen&egrave;ve.
Bonnivard en fut toujours un des plus fermes appuis:
pour assurer la libert&eacute; de notre R&eacute;publique, il ne craignit
pas de perdre souvent la sienne; il oublia son repos; il
m&eacute;prisa ses richesses; il ne n&eacute;gligea rien pour affermir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
le bonheur d'une patrie qu'il honora de son choix: d&egrave;s ce
moment il la ch&eacute;rit comme le plus z&eacute;l&eacute; de ses citoyens;
il la servit avec l'intr&eacute;pidit&eacute; d'un h&eacute;ros, et il &eacute;crivit son
Histoire avec la na&iuml;vet&eacute; d'un philosophe et la chaleur
d'un patriote.</p>

<p>"Il dit dans le commencement de son Histoire de
Gen&egrave;ve, que, <i>d&egrave;s qu'il eut commenc&eacute; de lire l'histoire des
nations, il se sentit entra&icirc;n&eacute; par son go&ucirc;t pour les R&eacute;publiques,
dont il &eacute;pousa toujours les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts:</i> c'est ce go&ucirc;t pour la
libert&eacute; qui lui fit sans doute adopter Gen&egrave;ve pour sa
patrie....</p>

<p>"Bonnivard, encore jeune, s'annon&ccedil;a hautement
comme le d&eacute;fenseur de Gen&egrave;ve contre le Duc de Savoye
et l'Ev&ecirc;que....</p>

<p>"En 1519, Bonnivard devient le martyr de sa patrie:
Le Duc de Savoye &eacute;tant entr&eacute; dans Gen&egrave;ve avec cinq
cent hommes, Bonnivard craint le ressentiment du Duc;
il voulut se retirer &agrave; Fribourg pour en &eacute;viter les suites;
mais il fut trahi par deux hommes qui l'accompagnaient,
et conduit par ordre du Prince &agrave; Grol&eacute;e, o&ugrave; il resta
prisonnier pendant deux ans. Bonnivard &eacute;tait malheureux
dans ses voyages: comme ses malheurs n'avaient point
ralenti son z&egrave;le pour Gen&egrave;ve, il &eacute;tait toujours un ennemi
redoutable pour ceux qui la mena&ccedil;aient, et par cons&eacute;quent
il devait &ecirc;tre expos&eacute; &agrave; leurs coups. Il fut rencontr&eacute;
en 1530 sur le Jura par des voleurs, qui le d&eacute;pouill&egrave;rent,
et qui le mirent encore entre les mains du Duc de Savoye:
ce Prince le fit enfermer dans le Ch&acirc;teau de Chillon, o&ugrave;
il resta sans &ecirc;tre interrog&eacute; jusques en 1536; il fut alors
delivr&eacute; par les Bernois, qui s'empar&egrave;rent du Pays-de-Vaud.</p>

<p>"Bonnivard, en sortant de sa captivit&eacute;, eut le plaisir
de trouver Gen&egrave;ve libre et r&eacute;form&eacute;e: la R&eacute;publique
s'empressa de lui t&eacute;moigner sa reconnaissance, et de le
d&eacute;dommager des maux qu'il avoit soufferts; elle le re&ccedil;ut
Bourgeois de la ville au mois de Juin, 1536; elle lui
donna la maison habit&eacute;e autrefois par le Vicaire-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral,
et elle lui assigna une pension de deux cent &eacute;cus d'or
tant qu'il s&eacute;journerait &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve. Il fut admis dans le
Conseil des Deux-Cent en 1537.</p>

<p>"Bonnivard n'a pas fini d'&ecirc;tre utile: apr&egrave;s avoir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
travaill&eacute; &agrave; rendre Gen&egrave;ve libre, il r&eacute;ussit &agrave; la rendre
tol&eacute;rante. Bonnivard engagea le Conseil &agrave; accorder [aux
eccl&eacute;siastiques et aux paysans] un tems suffisant pour
examiner les propositions qu'on leur faisait; il r&eacute;ussit par
sa douceur: on pr&ecirc;che toujours le Christianisme avec
succ&egrave;s quand on le pr&ecirc;che avec charit&eacute;....</p>

<p>"Bonnivard fut savant: ses manuscrits, qui sont dans
la biblioth&egrave;que publique, prouvent qu'il avait bien lu les
auteurs classiques Latins, et qu'il avait approfondi la
th&eacute;ologie et l'histoire. Ce grand homme aimait les
sciences, et il croyait qu'elles pouvaient faire la gloire de
Gen&egrave;ve; aussi il ne n&eacute;gligea rien pour les fixer dans cette
ville naissante; en 1551 il donna sa biblioth&egrave;que au
public; elle fut le commencement de notre biblioth&egrave;que
publique; et ces livres sont en partie les rares et belles
&eacute;ditions du quinzi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle qu'on voit dans notre
collection. Enfin, pendant la m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e, ce bon
patriote institua la R&eacute;publique son h&eacute;riti&egrave;re, &agrave; condition
qu'elle employerait ses biens &agrave; entretenir le coll&egrave;ge dont
on projettait la fondation.</p>

<p>"Il parait que Bonnivard mourut en 1570; mais on
ne peut l'assurer, parcequ'il y a une lacune dans le
N&eacute;crologe depuis le mois de Juillet, 1570, jusques en
1571."&mdash;[<i>Histoire Litt&eacute;raire de Gen&egrave;ve</i>, par Jean Senebier
(1741-1809), 1786, i. 131-137.]</p>

and transparent shining, which the curves of the vaults send back all

Villeneuve, which last is at one extremity of the Lake of Geneva. On its
left are the entrances of the Rhone, and opposite are the heights of
Meillerie and the range of Alps above Boveret and St. Gingo. Near it, on
a hill behind, is a torrent: below it, washing its walls, the lake has
been fathomed to the depth of 800 feet, French measure: within it are a
range of dungeons, in which the early reformers, and subsequently
prisoners of state, were confined. Across one of the vaults is a beam
black with age, on which we were informed that the condemned were
formerly executed. In the cells are seven pillars, or, rather, eight,
one being half merged in the wall; in some of these are rings for the
fetters and the fettered: in the pavement the steps of Bonnivard have
left their traces. He was confined here several years. It is by this
castle that Rousseau has fixed the catastrophe of his H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, in the
rescue of one of her children by Julie from the water; the shock of
which, and the illness produced by the immersion, is the cause of her
death. The ch&acirc;teau is large, and seen along the lake for a great
distance. The walls are white.

With Byron's description of Chillon, compare that of Shelley, contained
in a letter to Peacock, dated July 12, 1816 (<i>Prose Works of P. B.
Shelley</i>, 1880, ii. 171, sq.). The belief or tradition that Bonivard's
prison is "below the surface of the lake," for which Shelley as well as
Rousseau is responsible, but which Byron only records in verse, may be
traced to a statement attributed to Bonivard himself, who says
(<i>M&eacute;moires, etc.</i>, 1843, iv. 268) that the commandant thrust him "en
unes croctes desquelles le fond estoit plus bas que le lac sur lequel
Chillon estoit citue." As a matter of fact, "the level [of <i>les
souterrains</i>] is now three metres higher than the level of the water,
and even if we take off the difference arising from the fact that the
level of the lake was once much higher, and that the floor of the halls
has been raised, still the halls must originally have been built about
two metres above the surface of the lake."&mdash;<i>Guide</i>, etc., pp. 28, 29.]</p></div>

There is, too, in these lines (352-354), as in many others, an echo of

the "two undying fish" of Bowscale Tarn, and the "eagle lord of land and
sea" ministered to the shepherd-lord. It was no wonder that the critics
of 1816 animadverted on Byron's "communion" with the Lakers. "He could
not," writes a Critical Reviewer (Series V. vol. iv. pp. 567-581),
"carry many volumes on his tour, but among the few, we will venture to
predict, are found the two volumes of poems lately republished by Mr.
Wordsworth.... Such is the effect of reading and enjoying the poetry of
Mr. W., to whose system (ridiculed alike by those who could not, and who
would not understand it) Lord Byron, it is evident, has become a tardy
convert, and of whose merits in the poems on our table we have a silent

INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE DREAM</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>The Dream</i></span>, which was written at Diodati in July, 1816 (probably
towards the end of the month; see letters to Murray and Rogers, dated
July 22 and July 29), is a retrospect and an apology. It consists of an
opening stanza, or section, on the psychology of dreams, followed by
some episodes or dissolving views, which purport to be the successive
stages of a dream. Stanzas ii. and iii. are descriptive of Annesley Park
and Hall, and detail two incidents of Byron's boyish passion for his
neighbour and distant cousin, Mary Anne Chaworth. The first scene takes
place on the top of "Diadem Hill," the "cape" or rounded spur of the
long ridge of Howatt Hill, which lies about half a mile to the
south-east of the hall. The time is the late summer or early autumn of
1803. The "Sun of Love" has not yet declined, and the "one beloved face"
is still shining on him; but he is beginning to realize that "her sighs
are not for him," that she is out of his reach. The second scene, which
belongs to the following year, 1804, is laid in the "antique oratory"
(not, as Moore explains, another name for the hall, but "a small room
built over the porch, or principal entrance of the hall, and looking
into the courtyard"), and depicts the final parting. His doom has been
pronounced, and his first impulse is to pen some passionate reproach,
but his heart fails him at the sight of the "Lady of his Love," serene
and smiling, and he bids her farewell with smiles on his lips, but grief
unutterable in his heart.</p>

<p>Stanza iv. recalls an incident of his Eastern travels&mdash;a halt at noonday
by a fountain on the route from Smyrna to Ephesus (March 14, 1810), "the
heads of camels were seen peeping above the tall reeds" (see <i>Travels in
Albania</i>, 1858, ii. 59.).</p>

<p>The next episode (stanza v.) depicts an imaginary scene, suggested,
perhaps, by some rumour or more definite assurance, and often present to
his "inward eye"&mdash;the "one beloved," the mother of a happy family, but
herself a forsaken and unhappy wife.</p>

<p>He passes on (stanza vi.) to his marriage in 1815, his bride "gentle"
and "fair," but <i>not</i> the "one beloved,"&mdash;to the wedding day, when he
stood before an altar, "like one forlorn," confused by the sudden vision
of the past fulfilled with Love the "indestructible"!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In stanza vii. he records and analyzes the "sickness of the soul," the
so-called "phrenzy" which had overtaken and changed the "Lady of his
Love;" and, finally (stanza viii.), he lays bare the desolation of his
heart, depicting himself as at enmity with mankind, but submissive to
Nature, the "Spirit of the Universe," if, haply, there may be "reserved
a blessing" even for him, the rejected and the outlaw.</p>

<p>Moore says (<i>Life</i>, p. 321) that <i>The Dream</i> cost its author "many a
tear in writing"&mdash;being, indeed, the most mournful as well as
picturesque "story of a wandering life" that ever came from the pen and
heart of man. In his <i>Real Lord Byron</i> (i. 284) Mr. Cordy Jeaffreson
maintains that <i>The Dream</i> "has no autobiographical value.... A dream it
was, as false as dreams usually are." The character of the poet, as well
as the poem itself, suggests another criticism. Byron suffered or
enjoyed vivid dreams, and, as poets will, shaped his dreams, consciously
and of set purpose, to the furtherance of his art, but nothing
concerning himself interested him or awoke the slumbering chord which
was not based on actual fact. If the meeting on the "cape crowned with a
peculiar diadem," and the final interview in the "antique oratory" had
never happened or happened otherwise; if he had not "quivered" during
the wedding service at Seaham; if a vision of Annesley and Mary Chaworth
had not flashed into his soul,&mdash;he would have taken no pleasure in
devising these incidents and details, and weaving them into a fictitious
narrative. He took himself too seriously to invent and dwell lovingly on
the acts and sufferings of an imaginary Byron. The Dream is
"picturesque" because the accidents of the scenes are dealt with not
historically, but artistically, are omitted or supplied according to
poetical licence; but the record is neither false, nor imaginary, nor
unusual. On the other hand, the composition and publication of the poem
must be set down, if not to malice and revenge, at least to the
preoccupancy of chagrin and remorse, which compelled him to take the
world into his confidence, cost what it might to his own self-respect,
or the peace of mind and happiness of others.</p>

circumstances, with Lord Byron's own prose account of the wedding in his
Memoranda; in which he describes himself as waking, on the morning of
his marriage, with the most melancholy reflections, on seeing his
wedding-suit spread out before him. In the same mood, he wandered about
the grounds alone, till he was summoned for the ceremony, and joined,
for the first time on that day, his bride and her family. He knelt
down&mdash;he repeated the words after the clergyman; but a mist was before
his eyes&mdash;his thoughts were elsewhere: and he was but awakened by the
congratulations of the bystanders to find that he was&mdash;married."&mdash;<i>Life</i>, p. 272.

Medwin, too, makes Byron say (<i>Conversations, etc.</i>, 1824, p. 46) that
he "trembled like a leaf, made the wrong responses, and after the
ceremony called her (the bride) Miss Milbanke." All that can be said of
Moore's recollection of the "memoranda," or Medwin's repetition of
so-called conversations (reprinted almost <i>verbatim</i> in <i>Life, Writings,
Opinions, etc.</i>, 1825, ii. 227, <i>seq.</i>, as "Recollections of the Lately
Destroyed Manuscript," etc.), is that they tend to show that Byron meant
<i>The Dream</i> to be taken literally as a record of actual events. He would
not have forgotten by July, 1816, circumstances of great import which
had taken place in December, 1815: and he's either lying of malice
prepense or telling "an ower true tale."]</p></div>

xvi. p. 204) did not take kindly to <i>Darkness</i>. He regarded the "framing
of such phantasms" as "a dangerous employment for the exalted and
teeming imagination of such a poet as Lord Byron. The waste of boundless
space into which they lead the poet, the neglect of precision which such
themes may render habitual, make them in respect to poetry what
mysticism is to religion." Poetry of this kind, which recalled "the
wild, unbridled, and fiery imagination of Coleridge," was a novel and
untoward experiment on the part of an author whose "peculiar art" it was
"to show the reader where his purpose tends." The resemblance to
Coleridge is general rather than particular. It is improbable that Scott
had ever read <i>Limbo</i> (first published in <i>Sibylline Leaves</i>, 1817), an
attempt to depict the "mere horror of blank nought-at-all;" but it is
possible that he had in his mind the following lines (384-390) from
<i>Religious Musings</i>, in which "the final destruction is impersonated"
(see Coleridge's note) in the "red-eyed Fiend:"&mdash;

Another and a less easily detected source of inspiration has been traced
(see an article on Campbell's <i>Last Man</i>, in the <i>London Magazine and
Review</i>, 1825, New Series, i. 588, seq.) to a forgotten but once popular
novel entitled <i>The Last Man, or Omegarus and Syderia, a Romance in
Futurity</i> (two vols. 1806). K&ouml;lbing (<i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>, etc., pp.
136-140) adduces numerous quotations in support of this contention. The
following may serve as samples: "As soon as the earth had lost with the
moon her guardian star, her decay became more rapid.... Some, in their
madness, destroyed the instruments of husbandry, others in deep despair
summoned death to their relief. Men began to look on each other with
eyes of enmity" (i. 105). "The sun exhibited signs of decay, its surface
turned pale, and its beams were frigid. The northern nations dreaded
perishing by intense cold ... and fled to the torrid zone to court the
sun's beneficial rays" (i. 120). "The reign of Time was over, ages of
Eternity were going to begin; but at the same moment Hell shrieked with
rage, and the sun and stars were extinguished. The gloomy night of chaos
enveloped the world, plaintive sounds issued from mountains, rocks, and
caverns,&mdash;Nature wept, and a doleful voice was heard exclaiming in the
air, 'The human race is no more!'"(ii. 197).
</p><p>
It is difficult to believe that Byron had not read, and more or less
consciously turned to account, the imagery of this novel; but it is
needless to add that any charge of plagiarism falls to the ground.
Thanks to a sensitive and appreciative ear and a retentive memory,
Byron's verse is interfused with manifold strains, but, so far as
<i>Darkness</i> is concerned, his debt to Coleridge or the author of
<i>Omegarus and Syderia</i> is neither more nor less legitimate than the debt
to Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Joel, which a writer in the <i>Imperial
Magazine</i> (1828, x. 699), with solemn upbraidings, lays to his charge.
</p><p>
The duty of acknowledging such debts is, indeed, "a duty of imperfect
obligation." The well-known lines in Tennyson's <i>Locksley Hall</i>&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
is surely an echo of an earlier prophecy from the pen of the author of
<i>Omegarus and Syderia</i>: "In the center the heavens were seen darkened by
legions of armed vessels, making war on each other!... The soldiers fell
in frightful numbers.... Their blood stained the soft verdure of the
trees, and their scattered bleeding limbs covered the fields and the
roofs of the labourers' cottages" (i. 68). But such "conveyings" are
honourable to the purloiner. See, too, the story of the battle between
the Vulture-cavalry and the Sky-gnats, in Lucian's <i>Ver&aelig; Histori&aelig;</i>, i.
16.]</p></div>

market"). See note by Charles De la Pryme, <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 1854,
Series I. vol. x. p. 378. There is a tablet to his memory on the south

were, doubtless, familiar to him:&mdash;

</div></div>
<p>
Byron spent Sunday, April 25, 1816, at Dover. He was to sail that night
for Ostend, and, to while away the time, "turned to Pilgrim" and thought
out, perhaps began to write, the lines which were finished three months
later at the Campagne Diodati.
</p><p>
"The Grave of Churchill," writes Scott (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, October,
1816), "might have called from Lord Byron a deeper commemoration; for,
though they generally differed in character and genius, there was a
resemblance between their history and character.... both these poets
held themselves above the opinion of the world, and both were followed
by the fame and popularity which they seemed to despise. The writings of
both exhibit an inborn, though sometimes ill-regulated, generosity of
mind, and a spirit of proud independence, frequently pushed to extremes.
Both carried their hatred of hypocrisy beyond the verge of prudence, and
indulged their vein of satire to the borders of licentiousness."
</p><p>
Save for the affectation of a style which did not belong to him, and
which in his heart he despised, Byron's commemoration of Churchill does
not lack depth or seriousness. It was the parallel between their lives
and temperaments which awoke reflection and sympathy, and prompted this
"natural homily." Perhaps, too, the shadow of impending exile had
suggested to his imagination that further parallel which Scott
deprecated, and deprecated in vain, "death in the flower of his age, and
in a foreign land."]</p></div>

lines Lord Byron has written, "The following poem (as most that I have
endeavoured to write) is founded on a fact; and this detail is an
attempt at a serious imitation of the style of a great poet&mdash;its
beauties and its defects: I say the <i>style</i>; for the thoughts I claim as
my own. In this, if there be anything ridiculous, let it be attributed
to me, at least as much as to Mr. Wordsworth: of whom there can exist
few greater admirers than myself. I have blended what I would deem to be
the beauties as well as defects of his style; and it ought to be
remembered, that, in such things, whether there be praise or dispraise,
there is always what is called a compliment, however unintentional."
There is, as Scott points out, a much closer resemblance to Southey's
"<i>English Eclogues,</i> in which moral truths are expressed, to use the
poet's own language, 'in an almost colloquial plainness of language,'
and an air of quaint and original expression assumed, to render the
sentiment at once impressive and <i>piquant</i>."]</p></div>

<span class="label">[64]</span></a> [Byron was a lover and worshipper of Prometheus as a boy.
His first English exercise at Harrow was a paraphrase of a chorus of the
<i>Prometheus Vinctus</i> of &AElig;schylus, line 528, <i>sq.</i> (see <i>Poetical Works</i>,
1898, i. 14). Referring to a criticism on <i>Manfred</i> (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
vol xxviii. p. 431) he writes (October 12, 1817, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv.
174): "The <i>Prometheus</i>, if not exactly in my plan, has always been so
much in my head, that I can easily conceive its influence over all or
any thing that I have written." The conception of an immortal sufferer
at once beneficent and defiant, appealed alike to his passions and his
convictions, and awoke a peculiar enthusiasm. His poems abound with
allusions to the hero and the legend. Compare the first draft of stanza
xvi. of the <i>Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte</i> (<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1900, iii.
312, var. ii.); <i>The Prophecy of Dante</i>, iv. 10, seq.; the <i>Irish
Avatar</i>, stanza xii. line 2, etc.]</p></div>

"many millions decomposed to clay," so he the absent is dead to the
absent, and the absent are dead to him. And what are the dead? the
aggregate of nothingness? or are they a multitude of atoms having

disapprobation in England. A writer in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>

He returned safely from the wreck of the <i>Wager</i> (in Anson's voyage),
and many years after circumnavigated the world, as commander of a
similar expedition" (Moore). Admiral the Hon. John Byron (1723-1786),
next brother to William, fifth Lord Byron, published his <i>Narrative</i> of
his shipwreck in the <i>Wager</i> in 1768, and his <i>Voyage round the World</i>
in the <i>Dolphin</i>, in 1767 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 3).]</p></div>

Moore was inclined to attribute Byron's "love of mountain prospects" in
his childhood to the "after-result of his imaginative recollections of
that period," but (as Wilson, commenting on Moore, suggests) it is
easier to believe that the "high instincts" of the "poetic child" did
not wait for association to consecrate the vision (<i>Life</i>, p. 8).]</p></div>

"of which the opening lines (1-6) are given in Moore's <i>Notices</i>, etc.
(1830, ii. 36), were written immediately after the failure of the
negotiation ... [i.e. the intervention] of Madame de Sta&euml;l, who had
persuaded Byron 'to write a letter to a friend in England, declaring
himself still willing to be reconciled to Lady Byron' (<i>Life</i>, p. 321),
but were not intended for the public eye." The verses were written in
September, and it is evident that since the composition of <i>The Dream</i>
in July, another "change had come over" his spirit, and that the mild
and courteous depreciation of his wife as "a gentle bride," etc., had
given place to passionate reproach and bitter reviling. The failure of
Madame de Sta&euml;l's negotiations must have been to some extent
anticipated, and it is more reasonable to suppose that it was a rumour
or report of the "one serious calumny" of Shelley's letter of September
29, 1816, which provoked him to fury, and drove him into the open
maledictions of <i>The Incantation</i> (published together with the <i>Prisoner
of Chillon</i>, but afterwards incorporated with <i>Manfred</i>, act i. sc. 1,

<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Moore was engaged on the Life of Sheridan, Byron gave him some
advice. "Never mind," he says, "the angry lies of the humbug Whigs.
Recollect that he was an Irishman and a clever fellow, and that we have
had some very pleasant days with him. Don't forget that he was at school
at Harrow, where, in my time, we used to show his name&mdash;R. B. Sheridan,
1765&mdash;as an honour to the walls. Depend upon it that there were worse
folks going, of that gang, than ever Sheridan was" (Letter to Moore,
September 19, 1818, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 261).</p>

<p>It does not appear that Byron had any acquaintance with Sheridan when he
wrote the one unrejected Address which was spoken at the opening of
Drury Lane Theatre, October 10, 1812, but that he met him for the first
time at a dinner which Rogers gave to Byron and Moore, on or before June
1, 1813. Thenceforward, as long as he remained in England (see his
letter to Rogers, April 16, 1816, <i>Letters,</i> 1899, iii 281, note 1),
he was often in his company, "sitting late, drinking late," not, of
course, on terms of equality and friendship (for Sheridan was past
sixty, and Byron more than thirty years younger), but of the closest and
pleasantest intimacy. To judge from the tone of the letter to Moore
(<i>vide supra</i>) and of numerous entries in his diaries, during Sheridan's
life and after his death, he was at pains not to pass judgment on a man
whom he greatly admired and sincerely pitied, and whom he felt that he
had no right to despise. Body and soul, Byron was of different stuff
from Sheridan, and if he "had lived to his age," he would have passed
over "the red-hot ploughshares" of life and conduct, not unscathed, but
stoutly and unconsumed. So much easier is it to live down character than
to live through temperament.</p>

<p>Richard Brinsley Sheridan (born October 30, 1751) died July 7, 1816.
<i>The Monody</i> was written at the Campagne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> Diodati, on July 17, at the
request of Douglas Kinnaird. "I did as well as I could," says Byron;
"but where I have not my choice I pretend to answer for nothing" (Letter
to Murray, September 29, 1816, <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 366). He told Lady
Blessington, however, that his "feelings were never more excited than
while writing it, and that every word came direct from the heart"
(<i>Conversations, etc.</i>, p. 241).</p>

<p>The MS., in the handwriting of Claire, is headed, "Written at the
request of D. Kinnaird, Esq., Monody on R. B. Sheridan. Intended to be
spoken at Dy. L<span class="sup">e</span>. T. Diodati, Lake of Geneva, July 18<span class="sup">th</span>, 1816.
Byron."</p>

<p>The first edition was entitled <i>Monody on the Death of the Right
Honourable R.B. Sheridan</i>. Written at the request of a Friend. To be
spoken at Drury Lane Theatre, London. Printed for John Murray, Albemarle
Street, 1816.
</p>
<p>It was spoken by Mrs. Davison at Drury Lane Theatre,
September 7, and published September 9, 1816.</p>

<p>When the <i>Monody</i> arrived at Diodati Byron fell foul of the title-page:
"'The request of a Friend:'&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>'Obliged by Hunger and request of friends.' </p></blockquote>

<p>"I will request you to expunge that same, unless you please to add, 'by
a person of quality, or of wit and honour about town.' Merely say,
'written to be spoken at D[rury] L[ane]'" (Letter to Murray, September
30, 1816, <i>Letters,</i> 1899, iii. 367). The first edition had been issued,
and no alteration could be made, but the title-page of a "New Edition,"
1817, reads, "<i>Monody, etc.</i> Spoken at Drury Lane Theatre. By Lord
Byron."]</p>

was delivered February 7, 1787. After having spoken for five hours and
forty minutes he sat down, "not merely amidst cheering, but amidst the
loud clapping of hands, in which the Lords below the bar and the
strangers in the Gallery joined" (<i>Critical ... Essays,</i> by T. B.
Macaulay, 1843, iii. 443). So great was the excitement that Pitt moved the
adjournment of the House. The next year, during the trial of Warren
Hastings, he took part in the debates on June 3,6,10,13, 1788. "The
conduct of the part of the case relating to the Princesses of Oude was
intrusted to Sheridan. The curiosity of the public to hear him was
unbounded.... It was said that fifty guineas had been paid for a single
ticket. Sheridan, when he concluded, contrived ... to sink back, as if
exhausted, into the arms of Burke, who hugged him with the energy of
generous admiration" (<i>ibid.,</i>iii 451, 452).]</p></div>

<a id="Note_73"></a>{73}[Only a few days before his death, Sheridan wrote thus
to Rogers: "I am absolutely undone and broken-hearted. They are going to
put the carpets out of window, and break into Mrs. S.'s room and <i>take
me</i>. For God's sake let me see you!" (Moore's <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, 1825,
ii. 455).
</p>
<p>
The extent and duration of Sheridan's destitution at the time of his
last illness and death have been the subject of controversy. The
statements in Moore's <i>Life</i> (1825) moved George IV. to send for Croker
and dictate a long and circumstantial harangue, to the effect that
Sheridan and his wife were starving, and that their immediate
necessities were relieved by the (then) Prince Regent's agent, Taylor
Vaughan (Croker's <i>Correspondence and Diaries</i>, 1884, i. 288-312). Mr.
Fraser Rae, in his <i>Life of Sheridan</i> (1896, ii. 284), traverses the
king's apology in almost every particular, and quotes a letter from
Charles Sheridan to his half-brother Tom, dated July 16, 1816, in which
he says that his father "almost slumbered into death, and that the
reports ... in the newspapers (<i>vide</i>, e.g., <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, July,
1816) of the privations and want of comforts were unfounded."
</p>
<p>
Moore's sentiments were also expressed in "some verses" (<i>Lines on the
Death of SH&mdash;R&mdash;D&mdash;N</i>), which were published in the newspapers, and are
reprinted in the <i>Life</i>, 1825, ii. 462, and <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1850, p.

<h3>
INTRODUCTION TO <i>MANFRED</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Byron</span> passed four months and three weeks in Switzerland. He arrived at
the H&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre at S&eacute;cheron, on Saturday, May 25, and he left the
Campagne Diodati for Italy on Sunday, October 6, 1816. Within that
period he wrote the greater part of the Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>,
he began and finished the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>, its seven attendant
poems, and the <i>Monody</i> on the death of Sheridan, and he began
<i>Manfred</i>.</p>

<p>A note to the "Incantation" (<i>Manfred</i>, act i. sc. 1, lines 192-261),
which was begun in July and published together with the <i>Prisoner of
Chillon</i>, December 5, 1816, records the existence of "an unfinished
Witch Drama" (First Edition, p. 46); but, apart from this, the first
announcement of his new work is contained in a letter to Murray, dated
Venice, February 15, 1817 (<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 52). "I forgot," he
writes, "to mention to you that a kind of Poem in dialogue (in blank
verse) or drama ... begun last summer in Switzerland, is finished; it is
in three acts; but of a very wild, metaphysical, and inexplicable kind."
The letter is imperfect, but some pages of "extracts" which were
forwarded under the same cover have been preserved. Ten days later
(February 25) he reverts to these "extracts," and on February 28 he
despatches a fair copy of the first act. On March 9 he remits the third
and final act of his "dramatic poem" (a definition adopted as a second
title), but under reserve as to publication, and with a strict
injunction to Murray "to submit it to Mr. G[ifford] and to whomsoever
you please besides." It is certain that this third act was written at
Venice (Letter to Murray, April 14), and it may be taken for granted
that the composition of the first two acts belongs to the tour in the
Bernese Alps (September 17-29), or to the last days at Diodati
(September 30 to October 5, 1816), when the <i>estro</i> (see Letter to
Murray, January 2, 1817) was upon him, when his "Passions slept," and,
in spite of all that had come and gone and could not go, his spirit was
uplifted by the "majesty and the power and the glory" of Nature.</p>

<p>Gifford's verdict on the first act was that it was "wonderfully
poetical" and "merited publication," but, as Byron had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
foreseen, he did
not "by any means like" the third act. It was, as its author admitted
(Letter to Murray, April 14) "damnably bad," and savoured of the "dregs
of a fever," for which the Carnival (Letter to Murray, February 28) or,
more probably, the climate and insanitary "palaces" of Venice were
responsible. Some weeks went by before there was either leisure or
inclination for the task of correction, but at Rome the <i>estro</i> returned
in full force, and on May 5 a "new third act of <i>Manfred</i>&mdash;the greater
part rewritten," was sent by post to England. <i>Manfred, a Dramatic
Poem</i>, was published June 16, 1817.</p>

<p><i>Manfred</i> was criticized by Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (No. lvi.,
August, 1817, vol. 28, pp. 418-431), and by John Wilson in the
<i>Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</i> (afterwards <i>Blackwood's, etc.</i>) (June,
1817, i. 289-295). Jeffrey, as Byron remarked (Letter to Murray, October
12, 1817), was "very kind," and Wilson, whose article "had all the air
of being a poet's," was eloquent in its praises. But there was a fly in
the ointment. "A suggestion" had been thrown out, "in an ingenious paper
in a late number of the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> [signed H. M. (John
Wilson), July, 1817], that the general conception of this piece, and
much of what is excellent in the manner of its execution, have been
borrowed from the <i>Tragical History of Dr. Faustus</i> of Marlow (<i>sic</i>);"
and from this contention Jeffrey dissented. A note to a second paper on
Marlowe's <i>Edward II</i>. (<i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, October, 1817)
offered explanations, and echoed Jeffrey's exaltation of <i>Manfred</i> above
<i>Dr. Faustus</i>; but the mischief had been done. Byron was evidently
perplexed and distressed, not by the papers in <i>Blackwood</i>, which he
never saw, but by Jeffrey's remonstrance in his favour; and in the
letter of October 12 he is at pains to trace the "evolution" of
<i>Manfred</i>. "I never read," he writes, "and do not know that I ever saw
the <i>Faustus</i> of Marlow;" and, again, "As to the <i>Faustus</i> of Marlow, I
never read, never saw, nor heard of it." "I heard Mr. Lewis translate
verbally some scenes of Goethe's <i>Faust</i> ... last summer" (see, too,
Letter to Rogers, April 4, 1817), which is all I know of the history of
that magical personage; and as to the germs of <i>Manfred</i>, they may be
found in the Journal which I sent to Mrs. Leigh ... when I went over
first the Dent, etc., ... shortly before I left Switzerland. I have the
whole scene of <i>Manfred</i> before me."</p>

<p>Again, three years later he writes (<i>&agrave; propos</i> of Goethe's review of
<i>Manfred</i>, which first appeared in print in his paper <i>Kunst und
Alterthum</i>, June, 1820, and is republished in Goethe's <i>S&auml;mmtliche
Werke</i> ... Stuttgart, 1874, xiii. 640-642;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
see <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v.
Appendix II. "Goethe and Byron," pp. 503-521): "His <i>Faust</i> I never
read, for I don't know German; but Matthew Monk Lewis (<i>sic</i>), in 1816,
at Coligny, translated most of it to me <i>viva voce</i>, and I was naturally
much struck with it; but it was the <i>Staubach</i> (<i>sic</i>) and the
<i>Jungfrau</i>, and something else, much more than Faustus, that made me
write <i>Manfred</i>. The first scene, however, and that of Faustus are very
similar" (Letter to Murray, June 7, 1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 36).
Medwin (<i>Conversations, etc.</i>, pp. 210, 211), who of course had not seen
the letters to Murray of 1817 or 1820, puts much the same story into
Byron's mouth.</p>

<p>Now, with regard to the originality of <i>Manfred</i>, it may be taken for
granted that Byron knew nothing about the "Faust-legend," or the
"Faust-cycle." He solemnly denies that he had ever read Marlowe's
<i>Faustus</i>, or the selections from the play in Lamb's <i>Specimens, etc.</i>
(see Medwin's <i>Conversations, etc.</i>, pp. 208, 209, and a hitherto
unpublished Preface to <i>Werner</i>, vol. v.), and it is highly improbable
that he knew anything of Calderon's <i>El M&aacute;gico Prodigioso</i>, which
Shelley translated in 1822, or of "the beggarly elements" of the legend
in Hroswitha's <i>Lapsus et Conversio Theophrasti Vice-domini</i>. But
Byron's <i>Manfred</i> is "in the succession" of scholars who have reached
the limits of natural and legitimate science, and who essay the
supernatural in order to penetrate and comprehend the "hidden things of
darkness." A predecessor, if not a progenitor, he must have had, and
there can be no doubt whatever that the primary conception of the
character, though by no means the inspiration of the poem, is to be
traced to the "Monk's" oral rendering of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, which he gave
in return for his "bread and salt" at Diodati. Neither Jeffrey nor
Wilson mentioned <i>Faust</i>, but the writer of the notice in the <i>Critical
Review</i> (June, 1817, series v. vol. 5, pp. 622-629) avowed that "this
scene (the first) is a gross plagiary from a great poet whom Lord Byron
has imitated on former occasions without comprehending. Goethe's <i>Faust</i>
begins in the same way;" and Goethe himself, in a letter to his friend
Knebel, October, 1817, and again in his review in <i>Kunst und Alterthum</i>,
June, 1820, emphasizes whilst he justifies and applauds the use which
Byron had made of his work. "This singular intellectual poet has taken
my <i>Faustus</i> to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment
for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling
principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them
remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot
enough admire his genius." Afterwards (see record of a conversation with
Herman F&uuml;rst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
von P&uuml;ckler, September 14, 1826, <i>Letters</i>, v. 511) Goethe
somewhat modified his views, but even then it interested him to trace
the unconscious transformation which Byron had made of his
Mephistopheles. It is, perhaps, enough to say that the link between
<i>Manfred</i> and <i>Faust</i> is formal, not spiritual. The problem which Goethe
raised but did not solve, his counterfeit presentment of the eternal
issue between soul and sense, between innocence and renunciation on the
one side, and achievement and satisfaction on the other, was not the
struggle which Byron experienced in himself or desired to depict in his
mysterious hierarch of the powers of nature. "It was the <i>Staubach</i> and
the <i>Jungfrau</i>, and something else," not the influence of <i>Faust</i> on a
receptive listener, which called up a new theme, and struck out a fresh
well-spring of the imagination. The <i>motif</i> of <i>Manfred</i> is
remorse&mdash;eternal suffering for inexpiable crime. The sufferer is for
ever buoyed up with the hope that there is relief somewhere in nature,
beyond nature, above nature, and experience replies with an everlasting
No! As the sunshine enhances sorrow, so Nature, by the force of
contrast, reveals and enhances guilt. <i>Manfred</i> is no echo of another's
questioning, no expression of a general world-weariness on the part of
the time-spirit, but a personal outcry: "De profundis clamavi!"</p>

<p>No doubt, apart from this main purport and essence of his song, his
sensitive spirit responded to other and fainter influences. There are
"points of resemblance," as Jeffrey pointed out and Byron proudly
admitted, between <i>Manfred</i> and the <i>Prometheus</i> of &AElig;schylus. Plainly,
here and there, "the tone and pitch of the composition," and "the victim
in the more solemn parts," are &AElig;schylean. Again, with regard to the
supernatural, there was the stimulus of the conversation of the Shelleys
and of Lewis, brimful of magic and ghost-lore; and lastly, there was the
glamour of <i>Christabel</i>, "the wild and original" poem which had taken
Byron captive, and was often in his thoughts and on his lips. It was no
wonder that the fuel kindled and burst into a flame.</p>

their reeds where the steeps appeared almost inaccessible, with the
surrounding scenery, realized all that I have ever heard or imagined of
a pastoral existence:&mdash;much more so than Greece or Asia Minor, for there
we are a little too much of the sabre and musquet order; and if there is
a Crook in one hand, you are sure to see a gun in the other:&mdash;but this

concerning the baths, he, smiling, ordered his disciples to ask the
inhabitants by what names the two lesser springs, that were fairer than
the rest, were called. To which the inhabitants replied, that 'the one
was called Love, and the other Love's Contrary, but for what reason they
knew not.' Upon which Iamblichus, who chanced to be sitting on the
fountain's edge where the stream flowed out, put his hand on the water,
and, having uttered a few words, called up from the depths of the
fountain a fair-skinned lad, not over-tall, whose golden locks fell in
sunny curls over his breast and back, so that he looked like one fresh
from the bath; and then, going to the other spring, and doing as he had
done before, called up another Amoretto like the first, save that his
long-flowing locks now seemed black, now shot with sunny gleams.
Whereupon both the Amoretti nestled and clung round Iamblichus as if
they had been his own children ... after this his disciples asked him no

the Greeks at the battle of Platea, and afterwards perished for an
attempt to betray the Laced&aelig;monians), and Cleonice, is told in
Plutarch's life of Cimon; and in the Laconics of Pausanias the sophist
in his description of Greece.
</p><p>
[The following is the passage from Plutarch: "It is related that when
Pausanias was at Byzantium, he cast his eyes upon a young virgin named
Cleonice, of a noble family there, and insisted on having her for a
mistress. The parents, intimidated by his power, were under the hard
necessity of giving up their daughter. The young woman begged that the
light might be taken out of his apartment, that she might go to his bed
in secresy and silence. When she entered he was asleep, and she
unfortunately stumbled upon the candlestick, and threw it down. The
noise waked him suddenly, and he, in his confusion, thinking it was an
enemy coming to assassinate him, unsheathed a dagger that lay by him,
and plunged it into the virgin's heart. After this he could never rest.
Her image appeared to him every night, and with a menacing tone repeated
this heroic verse&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Go to the fate which pride and lust prepare!'<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The allies, highly incensed at this infamous action, joined Cimon to
besiege him in Byzantium. But he found means to escape thence; and, as
he was still haunted by the spectre, he is said to have applied to a
temple at Heraclea, where the <i>manes</i> of the dead were consulted. There
he invoked the spirit of Cleonice, and entreated her pardon. She
appeared, and told him 'he would soon be delivered from all his
troubles, after his return to Sparta:' in which, it seems, his death was
enigmatically foretold." "Thus," adds the translator in a note, "we find
that it was a custom in the pagan as well as in the Hebrew theology to
conjure up the spirits of the dead, and that the witch of Endor was not
the only witch in the world."&mdash;Langhorne's <i>Plutarch</i>, 1838, p. 339.
</p><p>
The same story is told in the <i>Periegesis Gr&aelig;c&aelig;</i>, lib. iii. cap. xvii.,
but Pausanias adds, "This was the deed from the guilt of which Pausanias
could never fly, though he employed all-various purifications, received
the deprecations of Jupiter Phyxius, and went to Phigalea to the
Arcadian evocators of souls."&mdash;<i>Descr. of Greece</i> (translated by T.
Taylor), 1794, i. 304, 305.]</p></div>

note 2), Byron rode from Neuhaus, at the Interlaken end of Lake Thun,
to the Staubbach. On the way between Matten and M&uuml;llinen, not far from
the village of Wilderswyl, he passed the baronial Castle of Unspunnen,
the traditional castle of Manfred. It is "but a square tower, with
flanking round turrets, rising picturesquely above the surrounding
brushwood." On the same day and near the same spot he "passed a rock;
inscription&mdash;two brothers&mdash;one murdered the other; just the place for
it." Here, according to the Countess Guiccioli, was "the origin of
<i>Manfred</i>." It is somewhat singular that, on the appearance of
<i>Manfred</i>, a paper was published in the June number of the <i>Edinburgh
Monthly Magazine</i>, 1817, vol. i. pp. 270-273, entitled, "Sketch of a
Tradition related by a Monk in Switzerland." The narrator, who signs
himself P. F., professes to have heard the story in the autumn of 1816
from one of the fathers "of Capuchin Friars, not far from Altorf." It is
the story of the love of two brothers for a lady with whom they had
"passed their infancy." She becomes the wife of the elder brother, and,
later, inspires the younger brother with a passion against which he
struggles in vain. The fate of the elder brother is shrouded in mystery.
The lady wastes away, and her paramour is found dead "in the same pass
in which he had met his sister among the mountains." The excuse for
retelling the story is that there appeared to be "a striking coincidence
in some characteristic features between Lord Byron's drama and the Swiss
tradition."]</p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE LAMENT OF TASSO</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>


<p>The MS. of the <i>Lament of Tasso</i> is dated April 20, 1817. It was
despatched from Florence April 23, and reached England May 12 (see
<i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 384). Proofs reached Byron June 7, and
the poem was published July 17, 1817.</p>

<p>"It was," he writes (April 26), "written in consequence of my having
been lately in Ferrara." Again, writing from Rome (May 5, 1817), he asks
if the MS. has arrived, and adds, "I look upon it as a 'These be good
rhymes,' as Pope's papa said to him when he was a boy" (<i>Letters</i>, 1900,
iv. 112-115). Two months later he reverted to the theme of Tasso's
ill-treatment at the hands of Duke Alphonso, in the memorable stanzas
xxxv.-xxxix. of the Fourth Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> (<i>Poetical Works</i>,
1899, ii. 354-359; and for examination of the circumstances of Tasso's
imprisonment in the Hospital of Sant' Anna, <i>vide ibid.</i>, pp. 355, 356,
note 1).</p>

<p>Notices of the <i>Lament of Tasso</i> appeared in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
August, 1817, vol. 87, pp. 150, 151; in <i>The Scot's Magazine</i>, August,
1817, N.S., vol. i. pp. 48, 49; and a eulogistic but uncritical review
in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, November, 1817, vol. ii. pp.
142-144.</p>

<p>At Ferrara, in the Library, are preserved the original MSS. of Tasso's
Gierusalemme<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and of Guarini's Pastor Fido, with letters of Tasso,
one from Titian to Ariosto, and the inkstand and chair, the tomb and the
house, of the latter. But, as misfortune has a greater interest for
posterity, and little or none for the cotemporary, the cell where Tasso
was confined in the hospital of St. Anna attracts a more fixed attention
than the residence or the monument of Ariosto&mdash;at least it had this
effect on me. There are two inscriptions, one on the outer gate, the
second over the cell itself, inviting, unnecessarily, the wonder and the
indignation of the spectator. Ferrara is much decayed and depopulated:
the castle still exists entire; and I saw the court where Parisina and
Hugo were beheaded, according to the annal of Gibbon.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

prizione in Sant' Anna, questo mese di mezzio l'anno 1579"), Tasso
exclaims, "Ah, wretched me! I had designed to write, besides two epic
poems of most noble argument, four tragedies, of which I had formed the
plan. I had schemed, too, many works in prose, on subjects the most
lofty, and most useful to human life; I had designed to unite philosophy
with eloquence, in such a manner that there might remain of me an
eternal memory in the world. Alas! I had expected to close my life with
glory and renown; but now, oppressed by the burden of so many
calamities, I have lost every prospect of reputation and of honour. The
fear of perpetual imprisonment increases my melancholy; the indignities
which I suffer augment it; and the squalor of my beard, my hair, and
habit, the sordidness and filth, exceedingly annoy me. Sure am I, that,
if <span class="smcap">she</span> who so little has corresponded to my attachment&mdash;if she saw me in

endured all the horrors of a solitary sordid cell, and was under the
care of a gaoler whose chief virtue, although he was a poet and a man of
letters, was a cruel obedience to the commands of his prince.... His
name was Agostino Mosti.... Tasso says of him, in a letter to his

prevent him being molested by the other inmates, disturbed in his
studies, and treated disrespectfully by the governor's subordinates. In
the letter to his sister Cornelia, from which Hobhouse quotes, the
allusion is not to Mosti, but, according to Solerti, to the Cardinal
Luigi d'Este. Elsewhere (Letter 133, <i>Lettere</i>, ii. 88, 89) Tasso
describes Agostino Mosti as a rigorous and zealous Churchman, but far
too cultivated and courteous a gentleman to have exercised any severity
towards him <i>proprio motu</i>, or otherwise than in obedience to orders.]</p></div>

or secretly nourished, a consuming passion for Leonora d'Este, and it is
certain that the "Sister of his Sovereign" had nothing to do with his
being shut up in the Hospital of Sant' Anna. That poet and princess had
known each other for over thirteen years, that the princess was seven
years older than the poet, and, in March, 1579, close upon forty-two
years of age, are points to be considered; but the fact that she died in
February, 1581, and that Tasso remained in confinement for five years
longer, is a stronger argument against the truth of the legend. She was
a beautiful woman, his patroness and benefactress, and the theme of
sonnets and canzoni; but it was not for her "sweet sake" that Tasso lost
either his wits or his liberty.]</p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>BEPPO</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Beppo</span></i> was written in the autumn (September 6&mdash;October 12, <i>Letters</i>,
1900, iv. 172) of 1817, whilst Byron was still engaged on the additional
stanzas of the Fourth Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>. His new poem, as he
admitted from the first, was "after the excellent manner" of John
Hookham Frere's <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, known as <i>Whistlecraft</i> (<i>Prospectus and
Specimen of an intended National Work</i> by William and Robert
Whistlecraft, London, 1818<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>), which must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> reached him in the
summer of 1817. Whether he divined the identity of "Whistlecraft" from
the first, or whether his guess was an after-thought, he did not
hesitate to take the water and shoot ahead of his unsuspecting rival. It
was a case of plagiarism <i>in excelsis</i>, and the superiority of the
imitation to the original must be set down to the genius of the
plagiary, unaided by any profound study of Italian literature, or an
acquaintance at first hand with the parents and inspirers of
<i>Whistlecraft</i>.</p>

<p>It is possible that he had read and forgotten some specimens of Pulci's
<i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, which J. H. Merivale had printed in the <i>Monthly
Magazine</i> for 1806-1807, vol. xxi. pp. 304, 510, etc., and it is certain
that he was familiar with his <i>Orlando in Roncesvalles</i>, published in
1814. He distinctly states that he had not seen W. S. Rose's<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
translation of Casti's <i>Animali Parlanti</i> (first edition [anonymous],
1816), but, according to Pryse Gordon (<i>Personal Memoirs</i>, ii. 328), he
had read the original. If we may trust Ugo Foscolo (see "Narrative and
Romantic Poems of the Italians" in the <i>Quart. Rev</i>., April, 1819, vol.
xxi. pp. 486-526), there is some evidence that Byron had read
Forteguerri's <i>Ricciardetto</i> (translated in 1819 by Sylvester (Douglas)
Lord Glenbervie, and again, by John Herman Merivale, under the title of
<i>The Two First Cantos of Richardetto</i>, 1820), but the parallel which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
adduces (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_166">p. 166</a>) is not very striking or convincing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, after the poem was completed (March 25, 1818), he was
under the impression that "Berni was the original of <i>all</i> ... the
father of that kind [i.e. the mock-heroic] of writing;" but there is
nothing to show whether he had or had not read the <i>rifacimento</i> of
Orlando's <i>Innamorato</i>, or the more distinctively Bernesque <i>Capitoli</i>.
Two years later (see Letter to Murray, February 21, 1820, <i>Letters</i>,
1900, iv. 407; and "Advertisement" to <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>) he had
discovered that "Pulci was the parent of <i>Whistlecraft</i>, and the
precursor and model of Berni," but, in 1817, he was only at the
commencement of his studies. A time came long before the "year or two"
of his promise (March 25, 1818) when he had learned to simulate the
<i>vera imago</i> of the Italian Muse, and was able not only to surpass his
"immediate model," but to rival his model's forerunners and inspirers.
In the meanwhile a tale based on a "Venetian anecdote" (perhaps an
"episode" in the history of Colonel Fitzgerald and the Marchesa
Castiglione,&mdash;see Letter to Moore, December 26, 1816, <i>Letters</i>, 1900,
iv. 26) lent itself to "the excellent manner of Mr. Whistlecraft," and
would show "the knowing ones," that is, Murray's advisers, Gifford,
Croker, Frere, etc., that "he could write cheerfully," and "would repel
the charge of monotony and mannerism."</p>

<p>Eckermann, mindful of Goethe's hint that Byron had too much <i>empeiria</i>
(an excess of <i>mondanit&eacute;</i>&mdash;a <i>this</i>-worldliness), found it hard to read
<i>Beppo</i> after <i>Macbeth</i>. "I felt," he says, "the predominance of a
nefarious, empirical world, with which the mind which introduced it to
us has in a certain measure associated itself" (<i>Conversations of
Goethe, etc.</i>, 1874, p. 175). But <i>Beppo</i> must be taken at its own
valuation. It is <i>A Venetian Story</i>, and the action takes place behind
the scenes of "a comedy of Goldoni." A less subtle but a more apposite
criticism may be borrowed from "Lord Byron's Combolio" (<i>sic</i>),
<i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, 1822, xi. 162-165.</p>

<p><i>Beppo, a Venetian Story</i> (xcv. stanzas) was published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> February 28,
1818; and a fifth edition, consisting of xcix. stanzas, was issued May
4, 1818.</p>

<p>Jeffrey, writing in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (February, 1818, vol. xxix.
pp. 302-310), is unconcerned with regard to <i>Whistlecraft</i>, or any
earlier model, but observes "that the nearest approach to it [<i>Beppo</i>]
is to be found in some of the tales and lighter pieces of Prior&mdash;a few
stanzas here and there among the trash and burlesque of Peter Pindar,
and in several passages of Mr. Moore, and the author of the facetious
miscellany entitled the <i>Twopenny Post Bag</i>."</p>

<p>Other notices, of a less appreciative kind, appeared in the <i>Monthly
Review</i>, March, 1818, vol. 85, pp. 285-290; and in the <i>Eclectic
Review</i>, N.S., June, 1818, vol. ix. pp. 555-557.

Bards</i> (line 818) he is bracketed with Gifford and Macneil <i>honoris

the impression that he had sent him "an anonymous note ... accompanying
a copy of the <i>Castle of Chillon,</i> etc. [<i>sic</i>]." Sotheby affirmed that
he had not written the note, but Byron, while formally accepting the
disclaimer, refers to the firmness of his "former persuasion," and
renews the attack with increased bitterness. "As to <i>Beppo,</i> I will not
alter or suppress a syllable for any man's pleasure but my own. If there
are resemblances between Botherby and Sotheby, or Sotheby and Botherby,
the fault is not mine, but in the person who resembles,&mdash;or the persons
who trace a resemblance. <i>Who</i> find out this resemblance? Mr. S.'s

like "Wordswords and Co.," made excellent "copy." If he had not written
the "anonymous note," he was, from Byron's point of view, ridiculous and
a bore, and "ready to hand" to be tossed up in rhyme as <i>Botherby.</i> (For

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>MAZEPPA</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Mazeppa</span></i>, a legend of the Russian Ukraine, or frontier region, is based
on the passage in Voltaire's <i>Charles XII</i>. prefixed as the
"Advertisement" to the poem. Voltaire seems to have known very little
about the man or his history, and Byron, though he draws largely on his
imagination, was content to take his substratum of fact from Voltaire.
The "true story of Mazeppa" is worth re-telling for its own sake, and
lends a fresh interest and vitality to the legend. Ivan Stepanovitch
Mazeppa (or Mazepa), born about the year 1645, was of Cossack origin,
but appears to have belonged, by descent or creation, to the lesser
nobility of the semi-Polish Volhynia. He began life (1660) as a page of
honour in the Court of King John Casimir V. of Poland, where he studied
Latin, and acquired the tongue and pen of eloquent statesmanship.
Banished from the court on account of a quarrel, he withdrew to his
mother's estate in Volhynia, and there, to beguile the time, made love
to the wife of a neighbouring magnate, the <i>pane</i> or Lord Falbowski. The
intrigue was discovered, and to avenge his wrongs the outraged husband
caused Mazeppa to be stripped to the skin, and bound to his own steed.
The horse, lashed into madness, and terror-stricken by the discharge of
a pistol, started off at a gallop, and rushing "thorough bush, thorough
briar," carried his torn and bleeding rider into the courtyard of his
own mansion!</p>

<p>With regard to the sequel or issue of this episode, history is silent,
but when the curtain rises again (A.D. 1674) Mazeppa is discovered in
the character of writer-general or foreign secretary to Peter
Dorosh&eacute;nko, hetman or president of the Western Ukraine, on the hither
side of the Dni&eacute;per. From the service of Dorosh&eacute;nko, who came to an
untimely end, he passed by a series of accidents into the employ of his
rival, Samo&iuml;lovitch, hetman of the Eastern Ukraine, and, as his
secretary or envoy, continued to attract the notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> and to conciliate
the good will of the (regent) Tzarina Sophia and her eminent <i>boyard</i>,
Prince Basil Golitsyn. A time came (1687) when it served the interests
of Russia to degrade Samo&iuml;lovitch, and raise Mazeppa to the post of
hetman, and thenceforward, for twenty years and more, he held something
like a regal sway over the whole of the Ukraine (a fertile "no-man's
land," watered by the Dni&eacute;per and its tributaries), openly the loyal and
zealous ally of his neighbour and suzerain, Peter the Great.</p>

<p>How far this allegiance was genuine, or whether a secret preference for
Poland, the land of his adoption, or a long-concealed impatience of
Muscovite suzerainty would in any case have urged him to revolt, must
remain doubtful, but it is certain that the immediate cause of a final
reversal of the allegiance and a break with the Tsar was a second and
still more fateful <i>affaire du coeur</i>. The hetman was upwards of sixty
years of age, but, even so, he fell in love with his god-daughter,
Matr&eacute;na, who, in spite of difference of age and ecclesiastical kinship,
not only returned his love, but, to escape the upbraidings and
persecution of her mother, took refuge under his roof. Mazeppa sent the
girl back to her home, but, as his love-letters testify, continued to
woo her with the tenderest and most passionate solicitings; and,
although she finally yielded to <i>force majeure</i> and married another
suitor, her parents nursed their revenge, and endeavoured to embroil the
hetman with the Tsar. For a time their machinations failed, and
Matr&eacute;na's father, Kotch&uacute;bey, together with his friend Iskra, were
executed with the Tsar's assent and approbation. Before long, however,
Mazeppa, who had been for some time past in secret correspondence with
the Swedes, signalized his defection from Peter by offering his services
first to Stanislaus of Poland, and afterwards to Charles XII. of Sweden,
who was meditating the invasion of Russia.</p>

<p>"Pultowa's day," July 8, 1709, was the last of Mazeppa's power and
influence, and in the following year (March 31, 1710), "he died of old
age, perhaps of a broken heart," at V&aacute;rnitza, a village near Bender, on
the Dniester, whither he had accompanied the vanquished and fugitive
Charles.</p>

<p>Such was Mazeppa, a man destined to pass through the crowded scenes of
history, and to take his stand among the greater heroes of romance. His
deeds of daring, his intrigues and his treachery, have been and still
are sung by the wandering minstrels of the Ukraine. His story has passed
into literature. His ride forms the subject of an <i>Orientale</i> (1829) by
Victor Hugo, who treats Byron's theme symbolically; and the romance of
his old age, his love for his god-daughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> Matr&eacute;na, with its tragical
issue, the judicial murder of Kotch&uacute;bey and Iskra, are celebrated by the
"Russian Byron" Pushkin, in his poem <i>Poltava</i>. He forms the subject of
a novel, <i>Iwan Wizigin</i>, by Bulgarin, 1830, and of tragedies by I.
Slowacki, 1840, and Rudolph von Gottschall. From literature Mazeppa has
passed into art in the "symphonic poem" of Franz Lizt (1857); and, yet
again, <i>pour comble de gloire</i>, <i>Mazeppa, or The Wild Horse of Tartary</i>,
is the title of a "romantic drama," first played at the Royal
Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge, on Easter Monday, 1831; and revived at
Astley's Theatre, when Adah Isaacs Menken appeared as "Mazeppa," October
3, 1864. (<i>Peter the Great</i>, by Eugene Schuyler, 1884, ii. 115, <i>seq</i>.;
<i>Le Fils de Pierre Le Grand, Mazeppa, etc</i>., by Viscount E. Melchior de
Vog&uuml;&eacute;", Paris, 1884; <i>Peter the Great</i>, by Oscar Browning, 1899, pp.
219-229.)</p>

<p>Of the composition of Mazeppa we know nothing, except that on September
24, 1818, "it was still to finish" (<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 264). It was
published together with an <i>Ode</i> (<i>Venice: An Ode</i>) and <i>A Fragment</i>
(see <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. Appendix IV. pp. 446-453), June 28, 1819.</p>

<p>Notices of <i>Mazeppa</i> appeared in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, July,
1819, vol. v. p. 429 (for <i>John Gilpin</i> and <i>Mazeppa</i>, by William
Maginn, <i>vide ibid</i>., pp. 434-439); the <i>Monthly Review</i>, July, 1819,

survived took refuge in flight, the King&mdash;whose litter had been smashed

<span class="label">[254]</span></a> [John Casimir (1609-1672), Jesuit, cardinal, and king,
was a Little-Polander, not to say a pro-Cossack, and suffered in
consequence. At the time of his proclamation as King of Poland,
November, 1649, Poland was threatened by an incursion of Cossacks. The
immediate cause was, or was supposed to be, the ill treatment which
[Bogd&aacute;n Khmeln&iacute;tzky] a Lithuanian had received at the hands of the
Polish governor, Czaplinski. The governor, it was alleged, had carried
off, ravished, and put to death Khmeln&iacute;tzky's wife, and, not content
with this outrage, had set fire to the house of the Cossack, "in which
perished his infant son in his cradle." Others affirmed that the Cossack
had begun the strife by causing the governor "to be publicly and
ignominiously whipped," and that it was the Cossack's mill and not his
house which he burnt. Be that as it may, Casimir, on being exhorted to
take the field, declined, on the ground that the Poles "ought not to
have set fire to Khmeln&iacute;tzky's house." It is probably to this
unpatriotic determination to look at both sides of the question that he
earned the character of being an unwarlike prince. As a matter of fact,
he fought and was victorious against the Cossacks and Tartars at
Bereteskow and elsewhere. (See <i>Mod. Univ. Hist.</i>, xxxiv. 203, 217;

lines, was thinking of Theresa Gamba, Countess Guiccioli. He met her for
the first time "in the autumn of 1818, three days after her marriage,"
but it was not till April, 1819, that he made her acquaintance. (See
<i>Life</i>, p. 393, and <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 289.) The copy of <i>Mazeppa</i>
sent home to Murray is in the Countess Guiccioli's handwriting, but the
assertion (see Byron's <i>Works</i>, 1832, xi. 178), that "it is impossible
not to suspect that the Poet had some circumstances of his own personal
history, when he portrayed the fair Polish <i>Theresa</i>, her faithful
lover, and the jealous rage of the old Count Palatine," is open to
question. It was Marianna Segati who had "large, black, Oriental eyes,
with that peculiar expression in them which is seen rarely among
<i>Europeans</i> ... forehead remarkably good" (see lines 208-220); not
Theresa Guiccioli, who was a "blonde," with a "brilliant complexion and
blue eyes." (See Letters to Moore, November 17, 1816; and to Murray, May
6, 1819: <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 8, 289, note 1.) Moreover, the "Maid of
Athens" was called Theresa. Dr. D. Englaender, in his exhaustive
monologue, <i>Lord Byron's Mazeppa</i>, pp. 48, sq., insists on the identity
of the Theresa of the poem with the Countess Guiccioli, but from this
contention the late Professor K&ouml;lbing (see <i>Englische Studien</i>, 1898,
vol. xxiv. pp 448-458) dissents.]</p></div>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE PROPHECY OF DANTE</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Prophecy of Dante</i> was written at Ravenna, during the month of
June, 1819, "to gratify" the Countess Guiccioli. Before she left Venice
in April she had received a promise from Byron to visit her at Ravenna.
"Dante's tomb, the classical pinewood," and so forth, had afforded a
pretext for the invitation to be given and accepted, and, at length,
when she was, as she imagined, "at the point of death," he arrived,
better late than never, "on the Festival of the <i>Corpus Domini</i>" which
fell that year on the tenth of June (see her communication to Moore,
<i>Life</i>, p. 399). Horses and books were left behind at Venice, but he
could occupy his enforced leisure by "writing something on the subject
of Dante" (<i>ibid</i>., p. 402). A heightened interest born of fuller
knowledge, in Italian literature and Italian politics, lent zest to this
labour of love, and, time and place conspiring, he composed "the best
thing he ever wrote" (Letter to Murray, March 23, 1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1900,
iv. 422), his <i>Vision</i> (or <i>Prophecy</i>) <i>of Dante</i>.</p>

<p>It would have been strange if Byron, who had sounded his <i>Lament</i> over
the sufferings of Tasso, and who had become <i>de facto</i> if not <i>de jure</i>
a naturalized Italian, had forborne to associate his name and fame with
the sacred memory of the "Gran padre Alighier." If there had been any
truth in Friedrich Schlegel's pronouncement, in a lecture delivered at
Vienna in 1814, "that at no time has the greatest and most national of
all Italian poets ever been much the favourite of his countrymen," the
reproach had become meaningless. As the sumptuous folio edition (4
vols.) of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, published at Florence, 1817-19; a
quarto edition (4 vols.) published at Rome, 1815-17; a folio edition (3
vols.) published at Bologna 1819-21, to which the Conte Giovanni
Marchetti (<i>vide</i> the Preface, <i>post</i>, <a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
 contributed his famous
excursus on the allegory in the First Canto of the <i>Inferno</i>, and
numerous other issues remain to testify, Dante's own countrymen were
eager "to pay honours almost divine" to his memory. "The last age,"
writes Hobhouse, in 1817 (note 18 to Canto IV. of <i>Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage</i>, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1899, ii. 496), "seemed inclined to
undervalue him.... The present generation ... has returned to the
ancient worship, and the <i>Danteggiare</i> of the northern Italians is
thought even indiscreet by the more moderate Tuscans." Dante was in the
air. As Byron wrote in his Diary (January 29, 1821), "Read Schlegel
[probably in a translation published at Edinburgh, 1818]. Not a
favourite! Why, they talk Dante, write Dante, and think and dream Dante
at this moment (1821), to an excess which would be ridiculous, but that
he deserves it."</p>

<p>There was, too, another reason why he was minded to write a poem "on the
subject of Dante." There was, at this time, a hope, if not a clear
prospect, of political change&mdash;of throwing off the yoke of the Bourbon,
of liberating Italy from the tyrant and the stranger. "Dante was the
poet of liberty. Persecution, exile, the dread of a foreign grave, could
not shake his principles" (Medwin, <i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 242). The
<i>Prophecy</i> was "intended for the Italians," intended to foreshadow as in
a vision "liberty and the resurrection of Italy" (<i>ibid</i>., p. 241). As
he rode at twilight through the pine forest, or along "the silent shore
Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood," the undying past inspired him
with a vision of the future, delayed, indeed, for a time, "the flame
ending in smoke," but fulfilled after many days, a vision of a redeemed
and united Italy.</p>

<p>"The poem," he says, in the Preface, "may be considered as a metrical
experiment." In <i>Beppo</i>, and the two first cantos of <i>Don Juan</i>, he had
proved that the <i>ottava rima</i> of the Italians, which Frere had been one
of the first to transplant, might grow and flourish in an alien soil,
and now, by way of a second venture, he proposed to acclimatize the
<i>terza rima</i>. He was under the impression that Hayley, whom he had held
up to ridicule as "for ever feeble, and for ever tame," had been the
first and last to try the measure in English; but of Hayley's excellent
translation of the three first cantos of the <i>Inferno</i>
(<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Footnote_281">p. 244, note 1</a>),
praised but somewhat grudgingly praised by Southey, he had
only seen an extract, and of earlier experiments he was altogether
ignorant. As a matter of fact, many poets had already essayed, but
timidly and without perseverance, to "come to the test in the
metrification" of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> twenty-seven lines, "the
sole example in English literature of that period, of the use of <i>terza
rima</i>, obviously copied from Dante" (<i>Complete Works of Chaucer</i>, by the
Rev. W. Skeat, 1894, i. 76, 261), are imbedded in Chaucer's <i>Compleint
to his Lady</i>. In the sixteenth century Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry
Howard, Earl of Surrey ("Description of the restless state of a lover"),
"as novises newly sprung out of the schools of Dante, Ariosto, and
Petrarch" (Puttenham's <i>Art of Poesie</i>, 1589, pp. 48-50); and later
again, Daniel ("To the Lady Lucy, Countess of Bedford"), Ben Jonson, and
Milton (<i>Psalms</i> ii., vi.) afford specimens of <i>terza rima</i>. There was,
too, one among Byron's contemporaries who had already made trial of the
metre in his <i>Prince Athanase</i> (1817) and <i>The Woodman and the
Nightingale</i> (1818), and who, shortly, in his <i>Ode to the West Wind</i>
(October, 1819, published 1820) was to prove that it was not impossible
to write English poetry, if not in genuine <i>terza rima</i>, with its
interchange of double rhymes, at least in what has been happily styled
the "Byronic <i>terza rima</i>." It may, however, be taken for granted that,
at any rate in June, 1819, these fragments of Shelley's were unknown to
Byron. Long after Byron's day, but long years before his dream was
realized, Mrs. Browning, in her <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i> (1851), in the same
metre, re-echoed the same aspiration (see her <i>Preface</i>), "that the
future of Italy shall not be disinherited." (See for some of these
instances of <i>terza rima</i>, <i>Englische Metrik</i>, von Dr. J. Schipper,
1888, ii. 896. See, too, <i>The Metre of Dante's Comedy discussed and
exemplified</i>, by Alfred Forman and Harry Buxton Forman, 1878, p. 7.)</p>

<p>The MS. of the <i>Prophecy of Dante</i>, together with the Preface, was
forwarded to Murray, March 14, 1820; but in spite of some impatience on
the part of the author (Letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1901,
v. 20), and, after the lapse of some months, a pretty broad hint
(Letter, August 17, 1820, <i>ibid</i>., p. 165) that "the time for the Dante
would be good now ... as Italy is on the eve of great things,"
publication was deferred till the following year. <i>Marino Faliero, Doge
of Venice</i>, and the <i>Prophecy of Dante</i> were published in the same
volume, April 21, 1821.</p>

<p>The <i>Prophecy of Dante</i> was briefly but favourably noticed by Jeffrey in
his review of <i>Marino Faliero</i> (<i>Edinb. Rev.</i>, July, 1821, vol. 35, p.
285). "It is a very grand, fervid, turbulent, and somewhat mystical
composition, full of the highest sentiment and the highest poetry; ...
but disfigured by many faults of precipitation, and overclouded with
many obscurities. Its great fault with common readers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> will be that it
is not sufficiently intelligible.... It is, however, beyond all
question, a work of a man of great genius."</p>

<p>Other notices of <i>Marino Faliero</i> and the <i>Prophecy of Dante</i> appeared
in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>, April, 1821, vol. 9, pp. 93-103; in
the <i>Monthly Review</i>, May, 1821, Enlarged Series, vol. 95, pp. 41-50;
and in the <i>Eclectic Review</i>, June 21, New Series, vol. xv. pp.
518-527.</p>

<h3>PREFACE
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of a visit to the city of Ravenna in the summer of 1819,
it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the
subject of Tasso's confinement, he should do the same on Dante's
exile,&mdash;the tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objects<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
of interest in that city, both to the native and to the stranger.</p>

<p>"On this hint I spake," and the result has been the following four
cantos, in <i>terza rima</i>, now offered to the reader. If they are
understood and approved, it is my purpose to continue the poem in
various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age. The
reader is requested to suppose that Dante addresses him in the interval
between the conclusion of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> and his death, and
shortly before the latter event, foretelling the fortunes of Italy in
general in the ensuing centuries. In adopting this plan I have had in my
mind the Cassandra of Lycophron,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and the Prophecy of Nereus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> by
Horace, as well as the Prophecies of Holy Writ. The measure adopted is
the <i>terza rima</i> of Dante, which I am not aware to have seen hitherto
<i>tried in our language, except it may be by Mr. Hayley</i>,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> of whose
translation I never saw but one extract, quoted in the notes to <i>Caliph
Vathek</i>; so that&mdash;if I do not err&mdash;this poem may be considered as a
metrical experiment. The cantos are short, and about the same length of
those of the poet, whose name I have borrowed and most likely taken in
vain.</p>

<p>Amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day, it is
difficult for any who have a name, good or bad, to escape translation. I
have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of <i>Childe Harold</i><a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
translated into Italian <i>versi sciolti</i>,&mdash;that is, a poem written in the
<i>Spenserean stanza</i> into <i>blank verse</i>, without regard to the natural
divisions of the stanza or the sense. If the present poem, being on a
national topic, should chance to undergo the same fate, I would request
the Italian reader to remember that when I have failed in the imitation
of his great "Padre Alighier,"<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> I have failed in imitating that
which all study and few understand, since to this very day it is not yet
settled what was the meaning of the allegory<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> first canto of
the <i>Inferno</i>, unless Count Marchetti's ingenious and probable
conjecture may be considered as having decided the question.</p>

<p>He may also pardon my failure the more, as I am not quite sure that he
would be pleased with my success, since the Italians, with a pardonable
nationality, are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a
nation&mdash;their literature; and in the present bitterness of the classic
and romantic war, are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to
approve or imitate them, without finding some fault with his
ultramontane presumption. I can easily enter into all this, knowing what
would be thought in England of an Italian imitator of Milton, or if a
translation of Monti, Pindemonte, or Arici,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> should be held up to
the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays. But I
perceive that I am deviating into an address to the Italian reader,
where my business is with the English one; and be they few or many, I
must take my leave of both.</p>

seven "Pleiades" who adorned the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus (third
century B.C.), is "an iambic monologue of 1474 verses, in which
Cassandra is made to prophesy the fall of Troy ... with numerous other

encountered on the "desert slope" (<i>Inferno</i>, Canto I. lines 31, <i>sq.</i>),
were no doubt suggested by Jer. v. 6: "Idcirco percussit eos leo de
silva, lupus ad vesperam vastavit eos, pardus vigilans super civitates
corum." Symbolically they have been from the earliest times understood
as denoting&mdash;the panther, lust; the lion, pride; the wolf, avarice; the
sins affecting youth, maturity, and old age. Later commentators have
suggested that there may be an underlying political symbolism as well,
and that the three beasts may stand for Florence with her "Black" and
"White" parties, the power of France, and the Guelf party as typically
representative of these vices (<i>The Hell of Dante</i>, by A. J. Butler,

of the most powerful Guelph families, named Donati. Corso Donati was the
principal adversary of the Ghibellines. She is&mdash;described as being
"<i>Admodum morosa, ut de Xantippe Socratis philosophi conjuge scriptum
esse legimus,</i>" according to Giannozzo Manetti. But Lionardo Aretino is
scandalised with Boccace, in his life of Dante, for saying that literary
men should not marry. "Qui il Boccaccio non ha pazienza, e dice, le
mogli esser contrarie agli studj; e non si ricorda che Socrate, il pi&ugrave;
nobile filosofo che mai fusse, ebbe moglie e figliuoli e ufici nella
Repubblica nella sua Citt&agrave;; e Aristotile che, etc., etc., ebbe due

Vite di Dante, etc.</i>, Firenze, 1677, pp. 22, 23]. It is odd that honest
Lionardo's examples, with the exception of Seneca, and, for anything I
know, of Aristotle, are not the most felicitous. Tully's Terentia, and
Socrates' Xantippe, by no means contributed to their husbands'
happiness, whatever they might do to their philosophy&mdash;Cato gave away
his wife&mdash;of Varro's we know nothing&mdash;and of Seneca's, only that she was
disposed to die with him, but recovered and lived several years
afterwards. But says Leonardo, "L'uomo &egrave; <i>animale civile</i>, secondo piace
a tutti i filosofi." And thence concludes that the greatest proof of the
<i>animal's civism</i> is "la prima congiunzione, dalla quale multiplicata
nasce la Citt&agrave;."
</p><p>
[There is nothing in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, or elsewhere in his
writings, to justify the common belief that Dante was unhappily married,
unless silence may be taken to imply dislike and alienation. It has been
supposed that he alludes to his wife, Gemma Donati, in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>,
&sect; 36, "as a young and very beautiful lady, who was gazing upon me from a
window, with a gaze full of pity," "who remembered me many times of my
own most noble lady," whom he consented to serve "more because of her
gentle goodness than from any choice" of his own (<i>Convito</i>, ii. 2. 7),
but there are difficulties in the way of accepting this theory. There
is, however, not the slightest reason for believing that the words which
he put into the mouth of Jacopo Rusticucci, "La fiera moglie pi&ugrave;
ch'altro, mi nuoce" ["and truly, my savage wife, more than aught else,
doth harm me"] (<i>Inferno</i>, xvi. 45), were winged with any personal
reminiscence or animosity. But with Byron (see his letter to Lady Byron,
dated April 3, 1820, in which he quotes these lines "with intention"
[<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 2]), as with Boccaccio, "the wish was father to the
thought," and both were glad to quote Dante as a victim to matrimony.
</p><p>
Seven children were born to Dante and Gemma. Of these "his son Pietro,
who wrote a commentary on the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, settled as judge in
Verona. His daughter Beatrice lived as a nun in Ravenna" (<i>Dante</i>, by
Oscar Browning, 1891, p. 47).]</p></div>

vehicle for a commentary on his poetry, Dante argues "that natural love
moves the lover principally to three things: the one is to exalt the
loved object, the second is to be jealous thereof, the third is to
defend it ... and these three things made me adopt it, that is, our
mother-tongue, which naturally and accidentally I love and have loved."
Again, having laid down the premiss that "the magnanimous man always
praises himself in his heart; and so the pusillanimous man always deems
himself less than he is," he concludes, "Wherefore many on account of
this vileness of mind, depreciate their native tongue, and applaud that
of others; and all such as these are the abominable wicked men of Italy,
who hold this precious mother-tongue in vile contempt, which, if it be

large folio, with Landino's commentary; and upon the broad margin of the
leaves he designed with a pen and ink, all the interesting subjects.
This book was possessed by Antonio Montanti, a sculptor and architect in
Florence, who, being appointed architect to St. Peter's, removed to
Rome, and shipped his ... effects at Leghorn for Civit&agrave; Vecchia, among

Vatican, but one morning he was stopped by the chamberlain in waiting,
who said, "I have an order not to let you enter." Michel Angelo,
indignant at the insult, left Rome that very evening. Though Julius
despatched five couriers to bring him back, it was some months before he
returned. Even a letter (July 8, 1506), in which the Pope promised his
"dearly beloved Michel Angelo" that he should not be touched nor
offended, but be "reinstated in the apostolic grace," met with no
response. It was this quarrel with Julius II. which prevented the
completion of the sepulchral monument. The "Moses" and the figures
supposed to represent the Active and the Contemplative Life, and three
Caryatides (since removed) represent the whole of the original design,

rarely finds a friend. But, after mature consideration, I must, by my

asking and receiving absolution.... Is such an invitation then to return

all the world knows, and the labour and fatigue of unremitting study?

open to me a way that shall not derogate from the fame and honour of d.;

without first rendering myself inglorious, nay infamous, to the people
and republic of Florence? Bread, I hope, will not fail me."&mdash;<i>Epistola,

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO THE <i>MORGANTE MAGGIORE</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is possible that Byron began his translation of the First Canto of
Pulci's <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> (so called to distinguish the entire poem of
twenty-eight cantos from the lesser <i>Morgante</i> [or, to coin a title,
"<i>Morganid</i>"] which was published separately) in the late autumn of
1819, before he had left Venice (see his letter to Bankes, February 19,
1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 403). It is certain that it was finished at
Ravenna during the first week of his "domestication" in the Palazzo
Guiccioli (Letters to Murray, February 7, February 21, 1820). He took a
deal of pains with his self-imposed task, "servilely translating stanza
from stanza, and line from line, two octaves every night;" and when the
first canto was finished he was naturally and reasonably proud of his
achievement. More than two years had elapsed since Frere's
<i>Whistlecraft</i> had begotten <i>Beppo</i>, and in the interval he had written
four cantos of <i>Don Juan</i>, outstripping his "immediate model," and
equalling if not surpassing his model's parents and precursors, the
masters of "narrative romantic poetry among the Italians."</p>

<p>In attempting this translation&mdash;something, as he once said of his
Armenian studies, "craggy for his mind to break upon" (Letter to Moore,
December 5, 1816, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 10)&mdash;Byron believed that he was
working upon virgin soil. He had read, as he admits in his
"Advertisement," John Herman Merivale's poem, <i>Orlando in Roncesvalles</i>,
which is founded upon the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>; but he does not seem to
have been aware that many years before (1806, 1807) the same writer (one
of the "associate bards") had published in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i> (May,
July, 1806, etc., <i>vide ante</i> Introduction to <i>Beppo</i>, <a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>) a series
of translations of selected passages of the poem. There is no
resemblance whatever between Byron's laboured and faithful rendering of
the text, and Merivale's far more readable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> paraphrase, and it is
evident that if these selections ever passed before his eyes, they had
left no impression on his memory. He was drawn to the task partly on
account of its difficulty, but chiefly because in Pulci he recognized a
kindred spirit who suggested and compelled a fresh and final dedication
of his genius to the humorous epopee. The translation was an act of
devotion, the offering of a disciple to a master.</p>

<p>"The apparent contradictions of the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> ... the brusque
transition from piety to ribaldry, from pathos to satire," the
paradoxical union of persiflage with gravity, a confession of faith
alternating with a profession of mockery and profanity, have puzzled and
confounded more than one student and interpreter. An intimate knowledge
of the history, the literature, the art, the manners and passions of the
times has enabled one of his latest critics and translators, John
Addington Symonds, to come as near as may be to explaining the
contradictions; but the essential quality of Pulci's humour eludes
analysis.</p>

<p>We know that the poem itself, as Pio Rajna has shown, "the <i>rifacimento</i>
of two earlier popular poems," was written to amuse Lucrezia Tornabuoni,
the mother of Lorenzo de' Medici, and that it was recited, canto by
canto, in the presence of such guests as Poliziano, Ficino, and
Michelangelo Buonarotti; but how "it struck these contemporaries," and
whether a subtler instinct permitted them to untwist the strands and to
appraise the component parts at their precise ethical and spiritual
value, are questions for the exercise of the critical imagination. That
which attracted Byron to Pulci's writings was, no doubt, the co-presence
of faith, a certain <i>simplicity</i> of faith, with an audacious and even
outrageous handling of the objects of faith, combined with a facile and
wanton alternation of romantic passion with a cynical mockery of
whatsoever things are sober and venerable. <i>Don Juan</i> and the <i>Vision of
Judgment</i> owe their existence to the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>.</p>

<p>The MS. of the translation of Canto I. was despatched to England,
February 28, 1820. It is evident (see Letters, March 29, April 23, May
18, 1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 425, 1901, v. 17, 21) that Murray looked
coldly on Byron's "masterpiece" from the first. It was certain that any
new work by the author of <i>Don Juan</i> would be subjected to the severest
and most hostile scrutiny, and it was doubtful if a translation of part
of an obscure and difficult poem, vaguely supposed to be coarse and
irreligious, would meet with even a tolerable measure of success. At any
rate, in spite of many inquiries and much vaunting of its excellence
(see Letters, June 29, September 12, 1821, <i>Letters</i>, 1901,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> v. 314,
362), the MS. remained for more than two years in Murray's hands, and it
was not until other arrangements came into force that the translation of
the First Canto of the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i> appeared in the fourth and
last number of <i>The Liberal</i>, which was issued (by John Hunt) July 30,
1823.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Morgante Maggiore, of the first canto of which this translation is
offered, divides with the Orlando Innamorato the honour of having formed
and suggested the style and story of Ariosto.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The great defects of
Boiardo were his treating too seriously the narratives of chivalry, and
his harsh style. Ariosto, in his continuation, by a judicious mixture of
the gaiety of Pulci, has avoided the one; and Berni, in his reformation
of Boiardo's poem, has corrected the other. Pulci may be considered as
the precursor and model of Berni altogether, as he has partly been to
Ariosto, however inferior to both his copyists. He is no less the
founder of a new style of poetry very lately sprung up in England. I
allude to that of the ingenious Whistlecraft. The serious poems on
Roncesvalles in the same language, and more particularly the excellent
one of Mr. Merivale, are to be traced to the same source.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> It has
never yet been decided entirely whether Pulci's intention was or was not
to deride the religion which is one of his favourite topics. It appears
to me, that such an intention would have been no less hazardous to the
poet than to the priest, particularly in that age and country; and the
permission to publish the poem, and its reception among the classics of
Italy, prove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> that it neither was nor is so interpreted. That he
intended to ridicule the monastic life, and suffered his imagination to
play with the simple dulness of his converted giant, seems evident
enough; but surely it were as unjust to accuse him of irreligion on this
account, as to denounce Fielding for his Parson Adams, Barnabas,<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
Thwackum, Supple, and the Ordinary in Jonathan Wild,&mdash;or Scott, for the
exquisite use of his Covenanters in the "Tales of my Landlord."</p>

<p>In the following translation I have used the liberty of the original
with the proper names, as Pulci uses Gan, Ganellon, or Ganellone; Carlo,
Carlomagno, or Carlornano; Rondel, or Rondello, etc., as it suits his
convenience; so has the translator. In other respects the version is
faithful to the best of the translator's ability in combining his
interpretation of the one language with the not very easy task of
reducing it to the same versification in the other. The reader, on
comparing it with the original, is requested to remember that the
antiquated language of Pulci, however pure, is not easy to the
generality of Italians themselves, from its great mixture of Tuscan
proverbs; and he may therefore be more indulgent to the present attempt.
How far the translator has succeeded, and whether or no he shall
continue the work, are questions which the public will decide. He was
induced to make the experiment partly by his love for, and partial
intercourse with, the Italian language, of which it is so easy to
acquire a slight knowledge, and with which it is so nearly impossible
for a foreigner to become accurately conversant. The Italian language is
like a capricious beauty, who accords her smiles to all, her favours to
few, and sometimes least to those who have courted her longest. The
translator wished also to present in an English dress a part at least of
a poem never yet rendered into a northern language; at the same time
that it has been the original of some of the most celebrated productions
on this side of the Alps, as well of those recent experiments in poetry
in England which have been already mentioned.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>FRANCESCA OF RIMINI</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> MS. of "a <i>literal</i> translation, word for word (versed like the
original), of the episode of Francesca of Rimini" (Letter March 23,
1820, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 421), was sent to Murray from Ravenna, March
20, 1820 (<i>ibid</i>., p. 419), a week after Byron had forwarded the MS. of
the <i>Prophecy of Dante</i>. Presumably the translation had been made in the
interval by way of illustrating and justifying the unfamiliar metre of
the "Dante Imitation." In the letter which accompanied the translation
he writes, "Enclosed you will find, <i>line for line</i>, in <i>third rhyme</i>
(<i>terza rima</i>,) of which your British Blackguard reader as yet
understands nothing, Fanny of Rimini. You know that she was born here,
and married, and slain, from Cary, Boyd, and such people already. I have
done it into <i>cramp</i> English, line for line, and rhyme for rhyme, to try
the possibility. You had best append it to the poems already sent by
last three posts."</p>

<p>In the matter of the "British Blackguard," that is, the general reader,
Byron spoke by the card. Hayley's excellent translation of the three
first cantos of the <i>Inferno</i> (<i>vide ante</i>, "Introduction to the
<i>Prophecy of Dante</i>," <a href="#Page_237">p. 237</a>), which must have been known to a previous
generation, was forgotten, and with earlier experiments in <i>terza rima</i>,
by Chaucer and the sixteenth and seventeenth century poets, neither
Byron nor the British public had any familiar or definite acquaintance.
But of late some interest had been awakened or revived in Dante and the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>.</p>

<p>Cary's translation&mdash;begun in 1796, but not published as a whole till
1814&mdash;had met with a sudden and remarkable success. "The work, which had
been published four years, but had remained in utter obscurity, was at
once eagerly sought after. About a thousand copies of the first edition,
that remained on hand, were immediately disposed of; in less than three
months a new edition was called for." Moreover, the <i>Quarterly</i> and
<i>Edinburgh Reviews</i> were loud in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> praises (<i>Memoir of H. F. Cary</i>,
1847, ii. 28). Byron seems to have thought that a fragment of the
<i>Inferno</i>, "versed like the original," would challenge comparison with
Cary's rendering in blank verse, and would lend an additional interest
to the "Pulci Translations, and the Dante Imitation." <i>D&icirc;s aliter
visum</i>, and Byron's translation of the episode of <i>Francesca of Rimini</i>,
remained unpublished till it appeared in the pages of <i>The Letters and
Journals of Lord Byron</i>, 1830, ii. 309-311. (For separate translations
of the episode, see <i>Stories of the Italian Poets</i>, by Leigh Hunt, 1846,
i. 393-395, and for a rendering in blank verse by Lord [John] Russell,
see <i>Literary Souvenir</i>, 1830, pp. 285-287.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<div style="background-color:#DDD;">
<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b>: In the original work the Italian verse
of Dante was printed on pages facing Byron's translation so that the
two could be compared. Here, the Italian verse has been placed
following Byron's. To compare the two side by side, open a second

places Francesca and her lover Paolo among the lustful in the second
circle of Hell. Francesca, daughter of Guido Vecchio da Polenta, Lord of
Ravenna, married (circ. 1275) Gianciotto, second son of Malatesta da
Verrucchio, Lord of Rimini. According to Boccaccio (<i>Il Comento sopra la
Commedia</i>, 1863, i. 476, <i>sq.</i>), Gianciotto was "hideously deformed in
countenance and figure," and determined to woo and marry Francesca by
proxy. He accordingly "sent, as his representative, his younger brother
Paolo, the handsomest and most accomplished man in all Italy. Francesca
saw Paolo arrive, and imagined she beheld her future husband. That
mistake was the commencement of her passion." A day came when the lovers
were surprised together, and Gianciotto slew both his brother and his
wife.]</p></div>

<p>[<i>Marino Faliero</i> was produced for the first time at the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane, April 25, 1821. Mr. Cooper played "The Doge;" Mrs. W. West,
"Angiolina, wife of the Doge." The piece was repeated on April 30, May
1, 2, 3, 4, and 14, 1821.</p>

<p>A revival was attempted at Drury Lane, May 20, 21, 1842, when Macready
appeared as "The Doge," and Helen Faucit as "Angiolina" (see <i>Life</i> and
<i>Remains</i> of E. L. Blanchard, 1891, i. 346-348).</p>

<p>An adaptation of Byron's play, by W. Bayle Bernard, was produced at
Drury Lane, November 2, 1867. It was played till December 17, 1867.
Phelps took the part of "The Doge," and Mrs. Hermann of "Angiolina." In
Germany an adaptation by Arthur Fitger was performed nineteen times by
the "Meiningers," circ. 1887 (see <i>Englische Studien</i>, 1899, xxvii.

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>MARINO FALIERO</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Byron</span> had no sooner finished the first draft of <i>Manfred</i> than he began
(February 25, 1817) to lay the foundation of another tragedy. Venice was
new to him, and, on visiting the Doge's Palace, the veiled space
intended for the portrait of Marin Falier, and the "Giants' Staircase,"
where, as he believed, "he was once crowned and afterwards decapitated,"
had laid hold of his imagination, while the legend of the <i>Congiura</i>,
"an old man jealous and conspiring against the state of which he was ...
Chief," promised a subject which the "devil himself" might have
dramatized <i>con amore</i>.</p>

<p>But other interests and ideas claimed his attention, and for more than
three years the project slept. At length he slips into the postscript of
a letter to Murray, dated, "Ravenna, April 9, 1820" (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v.
7), an intimation that he had begun "a tragedy on the subject of Marino
Faliero, the Doge of Venice." The "Imitation of Dante, the Translation
of Pulci, the Danticles," etc., were worked off, and, in prospecting for
a new vein, a fresh lode of literary ore, he passed, by a natural
transition, from Italian literature to Italian history, from the
romantic and humorous <i>epopee</i> of Pulci and Berni, to the pseudo-classic
drama of Alfieri and Monti.</p>

<p>Jealousy, as "Monk" Lewis had advised him (August, 1817), was an
"exhausted passion" in the drama, and to lay the scene in Venice was to
provoke comparison with Shakespeare and Otway; but the man himself, the
fiery Doge, passionate but not jealous, a noble turned democrat <i>pro hac
vice</i>, an old man "greatly" finding "quarrel in a straw," afforded a
theme historically time-honoured, and yet unappropriated by tragic art.</p>

<p>There was, too, a living interest in the story. For history was
repeating itself, and "politics were savage and uncertain." "Mischief
was afoot," and the tradition of a conspiracy which failed might find an
historic parallel in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> a conspiracy which would succeed. There was "<span class="smcap">that</span>
brewing in Italy" which might, perhaps, inspire "a people to redress
itself," "and with a cry of, 'Up with the Republic!' 'Down with the
Nobility!' send the Barbarians of all nations back to their own dens!"
{<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 10, 12, 19.)</p>

<p>In taking the field as a dramatist, Byron sought to win distinction for
himself&mdash;in the first place by historical accuracy, and, secondly, by
artistic regularity&mdash;by a stricter attention to the dramatic "unities."
"History is closely followed," he tells Murray, in a letter dated July
17, 1820; and, again, in the Preface (<i>vide post</i>,
pp. <a href="#Page_332">332</a>-<a href="#Page_337">337</a>), which
is an expansion of the letter, he gives a list of the authorities which
he had consulted, and claims to have "transferred into our language an
historical fact worthy of commemoration." More than once in his letters
to Murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy, and encloses some
additional note, in which he points out and rectifies an occasional
deviation from the historical record. In this respect, at any rate, he
could contend on more than equal terms "with established writers," that
is, with Shakespeare and Otway, and could present to his countrymen an
exacter and, so, more lifelike picture of the Venetian Republic. It is
plain, too, that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake,
with a premature passion for erudition, and that he sought and found
relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of
research. If his history is at fault, it was not from any lack of
diligence on his part, but because the materials at his disposal or
within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading. He makes no
mention of the huge collection of Venetian archives which had recently
been deposited in the Convent of the Frari, or of Doria's transcript of
Sanudo's Diaries, bequeathed in 1816 to the Library of St. Mark; but he
quotes as his authorities the <i>Vit&aelig; Ducum Venetorum</i>, of Marin Sanudo
(1466-1535), the <i>Storia, etc.</i>, of Andrea Navagero (1483-1529), and the
<i>Principj di Storia, etc.</i>, of Vettor Sandi, which belongs to the latter
half of the eighteenth century. Byron's chroniclers were ancient, but
not ancient enough; and, though they "handed down the story" (see
Medwin, <i>Conversations</i>, p. 173), they depart in numerous particulars
from the facts recorded in contemporary documents. Unquestionably the
legend, as it appears in Sanudo's perplexing and uncritical narrative
(see, for the translation of an original version of the Italian,
<i>Appendix</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_462">462</a>-<a href="#Page_467">467</a>),
is more dramatic than the "low beginnings" of
the myth, which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries; but, like other legends, it is insusceptible of
proof. Byron's Doge is almost, if not quite, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> unhistorical as his
Bonivard or his Mazeppa. (See <i>Nuovo Archivio Veneto</i>, 1893, vol. v. pt.
i. pp. 95-197; 1897, vol. xiii. pt. i. pp. 5-107; pt. ii. pp. 277-374;
<i>Les Archives de Venise</i>, par Armand Baschet, 1870; <i>Storia della
Repubblica di Venizia</i>, Giuseppe Cappelletti, 1849, iv. pp. 262-317.)</p>

<p>At the close of the Preface, by way of an afterthought, Byron announces
his determination to escape "the reproach of the English theatrical
compositions" "by preserving a nearer approach to unity," by
substituting the regularity of French and Italian models for the
barbarities of the Elizabethan dramatists and their successors. Goethe
(<i>Conversations</i>, 1874, p. 114) is said to have "laughed to think that
Byron, who, in practical life, could never adapt himself, and never even
asked about a law, finally subjected himself to the stupidest of
laws&mdash;that of the <i>three unities</i>." It was, perhaps, in part with this
object in view, to make his readers smile, to provoke their
astonishment, that he affected a severity foreign to his genius and at
variance with his record. It was an agreeable thought that he could so
easily pass from one extreme to another, from <i>Manfred</i> to <i>Marino
Faliero</i>, and, at the same time, indulge "in a little sally of
gratuitous sauciness" (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, July, 1822, vol. xxvii, p.
480) at the expense of his own countrymen. But there were other
influences at work. He had been powerfully impressed by the energy and
directness of Alfieri's work, and he was eager to emulate the gravity
and simplicity, if not the terseness and conciseness, of his style and
language. The drama was a new world to conquer, and so far as "his own
literature" was concerned it appeared that success might be attainable
by "a severer approach to the rules" (Letter to Murray, February 16,
1821)&mdash;that by taking Alfieri as his model he might step into the first
rank of English dramatists.</p>

<p>Goethe thought that Byron failed "to understand the purpose" of the
"three unities," that he regarded the law as an end in itself, and did
not perceive that if a play was comprehensible the unities might be
neglected and disregarded. It is possible that his "blind obedience to
the law" may have been dictated by the fervour of a convert; but it is
equally possible that he looked beyond the law or its fulfilment to an
ulterior object, the discomfiture of the romantic school, with its
contempt for regularity, its passionate appeal from art to nature. If he
was minded to raise a "Grecian temple of the purest architecture"
(<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. Appendix III. p. 559), it was not without some
thought and hope of shaming, by force of contrast, the "mosque," the
"grotesque edifice" of barbarian contemporaries and rivals. Byron was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
"ever a fighter," and his claim to regularity, to a closer preservation
of the "unities," was of the nature of a challenge.</p>

<p><i>Marino Faliero</i> was dedicated to "Baron Goethe," but the letter which
should have contained the dedication was delayed in transit. Goethe
never saw the dedication till it was placed in his hands by John Murray
the Third, in 1831, but he read the play, and after Byron's death bore
testimony to its peculiar characteristics and essential worth. "Lord
Byron, notwithstanding his predominant personality, has sometimes had
the power of renouncing himself altogether, as may be seen in some of
his dramatic pieces, particularly in his <i>Marino Faliero</i>. In this piece
one quite forgets that Lord Byron, or even an Englishman, wrote it. We
live entirely in Venice, and entirely in the time in which the action
takes place. The personages speak quite from themselves and their own
condition, without having any of the subjective feelings, thoughts, and
opinions of the poet" (<i>Conversations</i>, 1874, p. 453).</p>

<p>Byron spent three months over the composition of <i>Marino Faliero</i>. The
tragedy was completed July 17 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 52), and the copying
(<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Footnote_482">p. 461, note 2</a>) a month later (August 16, 17, 1820). The
final draft of "all the acts corrected" was despatched to England some
days before October 6, 1820.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1821 (see Letters to Murray, January 11, 20, 1821,
<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 221-228), an announcement reached Byron that his
play was to be brought out at Drury Lane Theatre, by Elliston. Against
this he protested by every means in his power, and finally, on
Wednesday, April 25, four days after the publication of the first
edition (April 21, 1821), an injunction was obtained from Lord
Chancellor Eldon, prohibiting a performance announced for that evening.
Elliston pursued the Chancellor to the steps of his own house, and at
the last moment persuaded him to allow the play to be acted on that
night only. Legal proceeedings were taken, but, in the end, the
injunction was withdrawn, with the consent of Byron's solicitors, and
the play was represented again on April 30, and on five nights in the
following May. As Byron had foreseen, <i>Marino Faliero</i> was coldly
received by the playgoing public, and proved a loss to the "speculating
buffoons," who had not realized that it was "unfit for their Fair or
their booth" (Letter to Murray, January 20, 1821, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, v.
228, and p. 226, note 2. See, too, <i>Memoirs of Robert W. Elliston</i>,
1845, pp. 268-271).</p>

<p>Byron was the first to perceive that the story of Marino Faliero was a
drama "ready to hand;" but he has had many followers, if not imitators
or rivals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Marino Faliero</i>, trag&eacute;die en cinq actes," by Casimir Jean Fran&ccedil;ois
Delavigne, was played for the first time at the Theatre of Porte Saint
Martin, May 31, 1829.</p>

<p>In Germany tragedies based on the same theme have been published by Otto
Ludwig, Leipzig, 1874; Martin Grief, Vienna, 1879; Murad Effendi (Franz
von Werner), 1881, and others (<i>Englische Studien</i>, vol. xxvii. pp. 146,
147).</p>

<p><i>Marino Faliero</i>, a Tragedy, by A. C. Swinburne, was published in 1885.</p>

<p><i>Marino Faliero</i> was reviewed by Jeffrey, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
July 21, 1821, vol. 35, pp. 271-285; by Heber, in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, July, 1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-492; and by John Wilson, in

<h3>PREFACE.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conspiracy of the Doge Marino Faliero is one of the most remarkable
events in the annals of the most singular government, city, and people
of modern history. It occurred in the year 1355. Every thing about
Venice is, or was, extraordinary&mdash;her aspect is like a dream, and her
history is like a romance. The story of this Doge is to be found in all
her Chronicles, and particularly detailed in the "Lives of the Doges,"
by Marin Sanuto, which is given in the Appendix. It is simply and
clearly related, and is perhaps more dramatic in itself than any scenes
which can be founded upon the subject.</p>

<p>Marino Faliero appears to have been a man of talents and of courage. I
find him commander-in-chief of the land forces at the siege of
Zara,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> where he beat the King of Hungary and his army of eighty
thousand men, killing eight thousand men, and keeping the besieged at
the same time in check; an exploit to which I know none similar in
history, except that of C&aelig;sar at Alesia,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and of Prince Eugene at
Belgrade. He was afterwards commander of the fleet in the same war. He
took Capo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> d'Istria. He was ambassador at Genoa and Rome,&mdash;at which last
he received the news of his election to the dukedom; his absence being a
proof that he sought it by no intrigue, since he was apprised of his
predecessor's death and his own succession at the same moment. But he
appears to have been of an ungovernable temper. A story is told by
Sanuto, of his having, many years before, when podesta and captain at
Treviso, boxed the ears of the bishop, who was somewhat tardy in
bringing the Host.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> For this, honest Sanuto "saddles him with a
judgment," as Thwackum did Square;<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> but he does not tell us whether
he was punished or rebuked by the Senate for this outrage at the time of
its commission. He seems, indeed, to have been afterwards at peace with
the church, for we find him ambassador at Rome, and invested with the
fief of Val di Marino, in the march of Treviso, and with the title of
count, by Lorenzo, Count-bishop of Ceneda. For these facts my
authorities are Sanuto, Vettor Sandi,<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Andrea Navagero,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and the
account of the siege of Zara, first published by the indefatigable Abate
Morelli, in his <i>Monumenti Veneziani di varia Letteratura</i>, printed in
1796,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> all of which I have looked over in the original language. The
moderns, Dar&ugrave;, Sismondi, and Laugier, nearly agree with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> ancient
chroniclers. Sismondi attributes the conspiracy to his <i>jealousy</i>; but I
find this nowhere asserted by the national historians. Vettor Sandi,
indeed, says that "Altri scrissero che....dalla gelosa suspizion di esso
Doge siasi fatto (Michel Steno) staccar con violenza," etc., etc.; but
this appears to have been by no means the general opinion, nor is it
alluded to by Sanuto, or by Navagero; and Sandi himself adds, a moment
after, that "per altre Veneziane memorie traspiri, che non il <i>solo</i>
desiderio di vendetta lo dispose alla congiura ma anche la innata
abituale ambizion sua, per cui aneleva a farsi principe independente."
The first motive appears to have been excited by the gross affront of
the words written by Michel Steno on the ducal chair, and by the light
and inadequate sentence of the Forty on the offender, who was one of
their "tre Capi."<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> The attentions of Steno himself appear to have
been directed towards one of her damsels, and not to the
"Dogaressa"<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> herself, against whose fame not the slightest
insinuation appears, while she is praised for her beauty, and remarked
for her youth. Neither do I find it asserted (unless the hint of Sandi
be an assertion) that the Doge was actuated by jealousy of his wife; but
rather by respect for her, and for his own honour, warranted by his past
services and present dignity.</p>

<p>I know not that the historical facts are alluded to in English, unless
by Dr. Moore in his View of Italy<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. His account is false and
flippant, full of stale jests about old men and young wives, and
wondering at so great an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> effect from so slight a cause. How so acute
and severe an observer of mankind as the author of Zeluco could wonder
at this is inconceivable. He knew that a basin of water spilt on Mrs.
Masham's gown deprived the Duke of Marlborough of his command, and led
to the inglorious peace of Utrecht&mdash;that Louis XIV. was plunged into the
most desolating wars, because his minister was nettled at his finding
fault with a window, and wished to give him another occupation&mdash;that
Helen lost Troy&mdash;that Lucretia expelled the Tarquins from Rome&mdash;and that
Cava brought the Moors to Spain&mdash;that an insulted husband led the Gauls
to Clusium, and thence to Rome&mdash;that a single verse of Frederick
II.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> of Prussia on the Abb&eacute; de Bernis, and a jest on Madame de
Pompadour, led to the battle of Rosbach&mdash;that the elopement of
Dearbhorgil<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> with Mac Murchad conducted the English to the slavery
of Ireland that a personal pique between Maria Antoinette and the Duke
of Orleans precipitated the first expulsion of the Bourbons&mdash;and, not to
multiply instances of the <i>teterrima causa,</i> that Commodus, Domitian,
and Caligula fell victims not to their public tyranny, but to private
vengeance&mdash;and that an order to make Cromwell disembark from the ship in
which he would have sailed to America destroyed both King and
Commonwealth. After these instances, on the least reflection it is
indeed extraordinary in Dr. Moore to seem surprised that a man used to
command, who had served and swayed in the most important offices, should
fiercely resent, in a fierce age, an unpunished affront, the grossest
that can be offered to a man, be he prince or peasant. The age of
Faliero is little to the purpose, unless to favour it&mdash;</p>

<p>Laugier's reflections are more philosophical:&mdash;"Tale f&ugrave; il fine
ignominioso di un' uomo, che la sua nascit&agrave;, la sua et&agrave;, il suo
carattere dovevano tener lontano dalle passioni produttrici di grandi
delitti. I suoi <i>talenti</i> per lungo tempo esercitati ne' maggiori
impieghi, la sua capacit&agrave; sperimentata ne' governi e nelle ambasciate,
gli avevano acquistato la stima e la fiducia de' cittadini, ed avevano
uniti i suffragj per collocarlo alla testa della repubblica. Innalzato
ad un grado che terminava gloriosamente la sua vita, il risentimento di
un' ingiuria leggiera insinu&ograve; nel suo cuore tal veleno che bast&ograve; a
corrompere le antiche sue qualit&agrave;, e a condurlo al termine dei
scellerati; serio esempio, che prova <i>non esservi et&agrave;, in cui la
prudenza umana sia sicura, e che nell' uomo restano sempre passioni
capaci a disonorarlo, quando non invigili sopra se stesso</i>."<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>Where did Dr. Moore find that Marino Faliero begged his life? I have
searched the chroniclers, and find nothing of the kind: it is true that
he avowed all. He was conducted to the place of torture, but there is no
mention made of any application for mercy on his part; and the very
circumstance of their having taken him to the rack seems to argue any
thing but his having shown a want of firmness, which would doubtless
have been also mentioned by those minute historians, who by no means
favour him: such, indeed, would be contrary to his character as a
soldier, to the age in which he lived, and <i>at</i> which he died, as it is
to the truth of history. I know no justification, at any distance of
time, for calumniating an historical character: surely truth belongs to
the dead, and to the unfortunate: and they who have died upon a scaffold
have generally had faults enough of their own, without attributing to
them that which the very incurring of the perils which conducted them to
their violent death renders, of all others, the most improbable. The
black veil which is painted over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> place of Marino Faliero amongst
the Doges, and the Giants' Staircase<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>, where he was crowned, and
discrowned, and decapitated, struck forcibly upon my imagination; as did
his fiery character and strange story. I went, in 1819, in search of his
tomb more than once to the church San Giovanni e San Paolo; and, as I
was standing before the monument of another family, a priest came up to
me and said, "I can show you finer monuments than that." I told him that
I was in search of that of the Faliero family, and particularly of the
Doge Marino's. "Oh," said he, "I will show it you;" and, conducting me
to the outside, pointed out a sarcophagus in the wall with an illegible
inscription<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. He said that it had been in a convent adjoining, but
was removed after the French came, and placed in its present situation;
that he had seen the tomb opened at its removal; there were still some
bones remaining, but no positive vestige of the decapitation. The
equestrian statue<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> of which I have made mention in the third act as
before that church is not, however, of a Faliero, but of some other now
obsolete warrior, although of a later date. There were two other Doges
of this family prior to Marino; Ordelafo, who fell in battle at Zara, in
1117 (where his descendant afterwards conquered the Huns), and Vital
Faliero, who reigned in 1082. The family, originally from Fano, was of
the most illustrious in blood and wealth in the city of once the most
wealthy and still the most ancient families in Europe. The length I have
gone into on this subject will show the interest I have taken in it.
Whether I have succeeded or not in the tragedy, I have at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of
commemoration.</p>

<p>It is now four years that I have meditated this work; and before I had
sufficiently examined the records, I was rather disposed to have made it
turn on a jealousy in Faliero. But, perceiving no foundation for this in
historical truth, and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the
drama, I have given it a more historical form. I was, besides, well
advised by the late Matthew Lewis<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> on that point, in talking with
him of my intention at Venice in 1817. "If you make him jealous," said
he, "recollect that you have to contend with established writers, to say
nothing of Shakespeare, and an exhausted subject:&mdash;stick to the old
fiery Doge's natural character, which will bear you out, if properly
drawn; and make your plot as regular as you can." Sir William
Drummond<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> gave me nearly the same counsel. How far I have followed
these instructions, or whether they have availed me, is not for me to
decide. I have had no view to the stage; in its present state it is,
perhaps, not a very exalted object of ambition; besides, I have been too
much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any time.<a name="FNanchor_ct" id="FNanchor_ct"></a><a href="#Footnote_ct" class="fnanchor">[ct]</a> And I
cannot conceive any man of irritable feeling<a name="FNanchor_cu" id="FNanchor_cu"></a><a href="#Footnote_cu" class="fnanchor">[cu]</a> putting himself at the
mercies of an audience. The sneering reader, and the loud critic, and
the tart review, are scattered and distant calamities; but the trampling
of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production which, be
it good or bad, has been a mental labour to the writer, is a palpable
and immediate grievance, heightened by a man's doubt of their competency
to judge, and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his
judges. Were I capable of writing a play which could be deemed
stage-worthy, success would give me no pleasure, and failure great pain.
It is for this reason that, even during the time of being one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the committee of one of the theatres, I never made the attempt, and never
will<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.
But I wish that others would, for surely there is dramatic
power somewhere, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Joanna Baillie, and Milman, and John Wilson
exist. The <i>City of the Plague</i>[1816] and the <i>Fall of Jerusalem</i> [1820]
are full of the best "<i>mat&eacute;riel</i>" for tragedy that has been seen since
Horace Walpole, except passages of <i>Ethwald</i>[1802] and <i>De
Montfort</i>[1798]. It is the fashion to underrate Horace Walpole; firstly,
because he was a nobleman, and secondly, because he was a gentleman;
but, to say nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters, and
of the <i>Castle of Otranto</i>[1765], he is the "Ultimus Romanorum," the
author of the <i>Mysterious Mother</i>[1768], a tragedy of the highest order,
and not a puling love-play. He is the father of the first romance and of
the last tragedy in our language, and surely worthy of a higher place
than any living writer, be he who he may.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p><p>In speaking of the drama of <i>Marino Faliero</i>, I forgot to mention that
the desire of preserving, though still too remote, a nearer approach to
unity than the irregularity, which is the reproach of the English
theatrical compositions, permits, has induced me to represent the
conspiracy as already formed, and the Doge acceding to it; whereas, in
fact, it was of his own preparation and that of Israel Bertuccio. The
other characters (except that of the Duchess), incidents, and almost the
time, which was wonderfully short for such a design in real life, are
strictly historical, except that all the consultations took place in the
palace. Had I followed this, the unity would have been better preserved;
but I wished to produce the Doge in the full assembly of the
conspirators, instead of monotonously placing him always in dialogue
with the same individuals. For the real facts, I refer to the

While I was in the sub-committee of Drury Lane
Theatre, I can vouch for my colleagues, and I hope for myself, that we
did our best to bring back the legitimate drama. I tried what I could to
get <i>De Montford</i> revived, but in vain, and equally in vain in favour of
Sotheby's <i>Ivan</i>, which was thought an acting play; and I endeavoured
also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedy[<a href="#X377A">A</a>]. Those who are not
in the secret will hardly believe that the <i>School for Scandal</i> is the
play which has brought the <i>least money</i>, averaging the number of times
it has been acted since its production; so Manager Dibdin assured me. Of
what has occurred since Maturin's <i>Bertram</i> I am not aware[<a href="#X377B">B</a>]; so that I
may be traducing, through ignorance, some excellent new writers; if so,
I beg their pardon. I have been absent from England nearly five years,
and, till last year, I never read an English newspaper since my
departure, and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the
medium of the <i>Parisian Gazette</i> of Galignani, and only for the last
twelve months. Let me, then, deprecate all offence to tragic or comic
writers, to whom I wish well, and of whom I know nothing. The long
complaints of the actual state of the drama arise, however, from no
fault of the performers. I can conceive nothing better than Kemble,
Cooke, and Kean, in their very different manners, or than Elliston in
<i>Gentleman's</i> comedy, and in some parts of tragedy. Miss O'Neill[<a href="#X377C">C</a>] I
never saw, having made and kept a determination to see nothing which
should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons. Siddons and Kemble
were the <i>ideal</i> of tragic action; I never saw anything at all
resembling them, even in <i>person</i>; for this reason, we shall never see
again Coriolanus or Macbeth. When Kean is blamed for want of dignity, we
should remember that it is a grace, not an art, and not to be attained
by study. In all, <i>not</i> <span class="smcap">super</span>-natural parts, he is perfect; even his
very defects belong, or seem to belong, to the parts themselves, and
appear truer to nature. But of Kemble we may say, with reference to his
acting, what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose, "that
he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of
Plutarch."[<a href="#X377D">D</a>]

{339}[This appreciation of the <i>Mysterious Mother</i>, which
he seems to have read in Lord Dover's preface to Walpole's Letters to
Sir Horace Mann, provoked Coleridge to an angry remonstrance. "I venture
to remark, first, that I do not believe that Lord Byron spoke sincerely;
for I suspect that he made a tacit exception of himself at least....
Thirdly, that the <i>Mysterious Mother</i> is the most disgusting, vile,
detestable composition that ever came from the hand of man. No one with
a spark of true manliness, of which Horace Walpole had none, could have
written it."&mdash;<i>Table Talk</i>, March 20, 1834. Croker took a very different
view, and maintained "that the good old English blank verse, the force
of character expressed in the wretched mother ... argue a strength of
conception, and vigour of expression capable of great things," etc. Over
and above the reasonable hope and expectation that this provocative
eulogy of Walpole's play would annoy the "Cockneys" and the "Lakers,"
Byron was no doubt influenced in its favour by the audacity of the plot,
which not only put <i>septentrional</i> prejudices at defiance, but was an
instance in point that love ought not "to make a tragic subject unless
it is love furious, criminal, and hopeless" (Letter to Murray, January
4, 1821). He would, too, be deeply and genuinely moved by such verse as
this&mdash;

<i>Manfred</i>, which appeared in <i>Kunst und Alterthum</i> (ii. 2. 191) in May,
1820. In a letter to Murray, dated October 17, 1820 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v.
100), he enclosed a letter to Goethe, headed "For <i>Marino Faliero</i>.
Dedication to Baron Goethe, etc., etc., etc." It is possible that Murray
did not take the "Dedication" seriously, but regarded it as a <i>jeu
d'esprit</i>, designed for the amusement of himself and his "synod." At any
rate, the "Dedication" did not reach Goethe's hand till 1831, when it
was presented to him at Weimar by John Murray the Third. "It is
written," says Moore, who printed a mutilated version in his <i>Letters
and Journals, etc.</i>, 1830, ii. 356-358, "in the poet's most whimsical
and mocking mood; and the unmeasured severity poured out in it upon the

living English Authors</i>'[<a href="#X379A">A</a>] has not been translated into German.
You will have read, in your friend Schlegel's version, the dialogue
in <i>Macbeth</i>&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"'There are <i>ten thousand!</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Answer</i>.<span class="s23">&nbsp;</span><i>Authors</i>, sir.'[<a href="#X379B">B</a>]<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Now, of these 'ten thousand authors,' there are actually nineteen
hundred and eighty-seven poets, all alive at this moment, whatever
their works may be, as their booksellers well know: and amongst
these there are several who possess a far greater reputation than
mine, though considerably less than yours. It is owing to this
neglect on the part of your German translators that you are not
aware of the works of William Wordsworth, who has a baronet in
London[<a href="#X379C">C</a>] who draws him frontispieces and leads him about to
dinners and to the play; and a Lord in the country,[<a href="#X379D">D</a>] who gave him
a place in the Excise&mdash;and a cover at his table. You do not know
perhaps that this Gentleman is the greatest of all poets
past&mdash;present and to come&mdash;besides which he has written an '<i>Opus
Magnum</i>' in prose&mdash;during the late election for Westmoreland.[<a href="#X379E">E</a>]
His principal publication is entitled '<i>Peter Bell</i>' which he had
withheld from the public for '<i>one and twenty years</i>'&mdash;to the
irreparable loss of all those who died in the interim, and will
have no opportunity of reading it before the resurrection. There is
also another named Southey, who is more than a poet, being actually
poet Laureate,&mdash;a post which corresponds with what we call in Italy
Poeta Cesareo, and which you call in German&mdash;I know not what; but
as you have a '<i>Caesar</i>'&mdash;probably you have a name for it. In
England there is no <i>Caesar</i>&mdash;only the Poet.
</p>
<p>
"I mention these poets by way of sample to enlighten you. They form
but two bricks of our Babel, (<span class="smcap">Windsor</span> bricks, by the way) but may
serve for a specimen of the building.
</p>
<p>
"It is, moreover, asserted that 'the predominant character of the
whole body of the present English poetry is a <i>disgust</i> and
<i>contempt</i> for life.' But I rather suspect that by one single work
of <i>prose</i>, <i>you</i> yourself have excited a greater contempt for life
than all the English volumes of poesy that ever were written.
Madame de St&auml;el says, that 'Werther has occasioned more suicides
than the most beautiful woman;' and I really believe that he has
put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon
himself,&mdash;except in the way of his profession. Perhaps, Illustrious
Sir, the acrimonious judgment passed by a celebrated northern
journal[<a href="#X379F">F</a>] upon you in particular, and the Germans in general, has
rather indisposed you towards English poetry as well as criticism.
But you must not regard our critics, who are at bottom good-natured
fellows, considering their two professions,&mdash;taking up the law in
court, and laying it down out of it. No one can more lament their
hasty and unfair judgment, in your particular, than I do; and I so
expressed myself to your friend Schlegel, in 1816, at Coppet.
</p>
<p>
"In behalf of my 'ten thousand' living brethren, and of myself, I
have thus far taken notice of an opinion expressed with regard to
'English poetry' in general, and which merited notice, because it
was <span class="smcap">yours</span>.
</p>
<p>
"My principal object in addressing you was to testify my sincere
respect and admiration of a man, who, for half a century, has led
the literature of a great nation, and will go down to posterity as
the first literary Character of his Age.
</p>
<p>
"You have been fortunate, Sir, not only in the writings which have
illustrated your name, but in the name itself, as being
sufficiently musical for the articulation of posterity. In this you
have the advantage of some of your countrymen, whose names would
perhaps be immortal also&mdash;if anybody could pronounce them.
</p>
<p>
"It may, perhaps, be supposed, by this apparent tone of levity,
that I am wanting in intentional respect towards you; but this will
be a mistake: I am always flippant in prose. Considering you, as I
really and warmly do, in common with all your own, and with most
other nations, to be by far the first literary Character which has
existed in Europe since the death of Voltaire, I felt, and feel,
desirous to inscribe to you the following work,&mdash;<i>not</i> as being
either a tragedy or a <i>poem</i>, (for I cannot pronounce upon its
pretensions to be either one or the other, or both, or neither,)
but as a mark of esteem and admiration from a foreigner to the man
who has been hailed in Germany '<span class="smcap">the great Goethe</span>.'
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left:8em;">"I have the honour to be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:11em;">With the truest respect,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:14em;">Your most obedient and</span><br />

<p>
"P.S.&mdash;I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a
great struggle about what they call '<i>Classical</i>' and
'<i>Romantic</i>,'&mdash;terms which were not subjects of classification in
England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. Some of
the English Scribblers, it is true, abused Pope and Swift, but the
reason was that they themselves did not know how to write either
prose or verse; but nobody thought them worth making a sect of.
Perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately, but I
have not heard much about it, and it would be such bad taste that I
shall be very sorry to believe it."

Council.... Three electors shall be chosen to submit names of fresh

[Byron admits (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_340">p. 340</a>) that the character of
the "Dogaressa" is more or less his own creation. It may be remarked
that in Casimir Delavigne's version of the story, the Duchess (Elena)
cherishes a secret and criminal attachment for Bertuccio Faliero, and
that in Mr. Swinburne's tragedy, while innocent in act, she is smitten
with remorse for a passion which overmasters her loyalty to her husband.
Byron's Angiolina is "faultily faultless, ... splendidly null."
</p><p>
In a letter to Murray, dated January 4, 1821 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 218),
he says, "As I think that <i>love</i> is not the principal passion for
tragedy, you will not find me a popular writer. Unless it is Love,
<i>furious</i>, <i>criminal</i>, and <i>hapless</i> [as in <i>The Mysterious Mother</i>, or
in Alfieri's <i>Mirra</i>, or Shelley's <i>Cenci</i>], it ought not to make a
tragic subject. When it is melting and maudlin, it <i>does</i>, but it ought
not to do; it is then for the gallery and second-price boxes." It is
probable that he owed these sentiments to the theory and practice of
Vittorio Alfieri. "It is extraordinary," writes M. de Fallette Barrol
(<i>Monthly Magazine</i>, April, 1805, reprinted in Preface to <i>Tragedie di
Alfieri</i>, A. Montucci, Edinburgh, 1805, i. xvi. <i>sq.</i>), "that a man
whose soul possessed an uncommon share of ardour and sensibility, and
had experienced all the violence of the passions, should scarcely have
condescended to introduce love into his tragedies; or, when he does,
that he should only employ it with a kind of reserve and severity.... He
probably regarded it as a hackneyed agent; for in ... <i>Myrrha</i> it
appears in such a strange character, that all the art of the writer is
not capable of divesting it of an air at once ludicrous and disgusting."
</p><p>
But apart from the example of Alfieri, there was another motive at
work&mdash;a determination to prove to the world that he was the master of
his own temperament, and that, if he chose, he could cast away frivolity
and cynicism, and clothe himself with austerity "as with a garment." He
had been taken to task for "treating well-nigh with equal derision the
most pure of virtues, and the most odious of vices" (<i>Blackwood's Edin.
Mag.</i>, August, 1819), and here was an "answer to his accusers!"]</p></div>

look to the historical of the period prophesied, or rather of the few
years preceding that period. Voltaire calculated their "nostre bene
merite Meretrici" at 12,000 of regulars, without including volunteers
and local militia, on what authority I know not; but it is, perhaps, the
only part of the population not decreased. Venice once contained two
hundred thousand inhabitants: there are now about ninety thousand; and
THESE!! few individuals can conceive, and none could describe, the
actual state into which the more than infernal tyranny of Austria has
plunged this unhappy city. From the present decay and degeneracy of
Venice under the Barbarians, there are some honourable individual
exceptions. There is Pasqualigo, the last, and, alas! <i>posthumous</i> son
of the marriage of the Doges with the Adriatic, who fought his frigate
with far greater gallantry than any of his French coadjutors in the
memorable action off Lissa. I came home in the squadron with the prizes
in 1811, and recollect to have heard Sir William Hoste, and the other
officers engaged in that glorious conflict, speak in the highest terms
of Pasqualigo's behaviour. There is the Abbate Morelli. There is Alvise
Querini, who, after a long and honourable diplomatic career, finds some
consolation for the wrongs of his country, in the pursuits of literature
with his nephew, Vittor Benzon, the son of the celebrated beauty, the
heroine of "La Biondina in Gondoleta." There are the patrician poet
Morosini, and the poet Lamberti, the author of the "Biondina," etc., and
many other estimable productions; and, not least in an Englishman's
estimation, Madame Michelli, the translator of Shakspeare. There are the
young Dandolo and the improvvisatore Carrer, and Giuseppe Albrizzi, the
accomplished son of an accomplished mother. There is Aglietti, and were
there nothing else, there is the immortality of Canova. Cicognara,
Mustoxithi, Bucati, etc., etc., I do not reckon, because the one is a
Greek, and the others were born at least a hundred miles off, which,
throughout Italy, constitutes, if not a <i>foreigner</i>, at least a

is one very singular prophecy concerning Venice: 'If thou dost not
change,' it says to that proud republic, 'thy liberty, which is already

If we carry back the epocha of Venetian freedom to the establishment of
the government under which the republic flourished, we shall find that
the date of the election of the first Doge is 697: and if we add one
century to a thousand, that is, eleven hundred years, we shall find the
sense of the prediction to be literally this: 'Thy liberty will not last
till 1797.' Recollect that Venice ceased to be free in the year 1796,
the fifth year of the French republic; and you will perceive that there
never was prediction more pointed, or more exactly followed by the
event. You will, therefore, note as very remarkable the three lines of
Alamanni addressed to Venice; which, however, no one has pointed out:&mdash;

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Story of Marino Faliero, Doge XLIV. mcccliv</span>.<a name="FNanchor_483a" id="FNanchor_483a"></a><a href="#Footnote_483a" class="fnanchor">[483a]</a></p>

<p>On the eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1354, Marino
Faliero was elected and chosen to be the Duke of the Commonwealth of
Venice. He was Count of Valdemarino, in the Marches of Treviso, and a
Knight, and a wealthy man to boot. As soon as the election was
completed, it was resolved in the Great Council, that a deputation of
twelve should be despatched to Marino Faliero the Duke, who was then on
his way from Rome; for when he was chosen, he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span> ambassador at the
court of the Holy Father, at Rome,&mdash;the Holy Father himself held his
court at Avignon. When Messer Marino Faliero the Duke was about to land
in this city, on the 5th day of October, 1354, a thick haze came on and
darkened the air: and he was enforced to land on the place of Saint
Mark, between the two columns, on the spot where evil doers are put to
death; and all thought that this was the worst of tokens.&mdash;Nor must I
forget to write that which I have read in a chronicle.&mdash;When Messer
Marino Faliero was Podesta and Captain of Treviso, the Bishop delayed
coming in with the holy sacrament, on a day when a procession was to
take place. Now, the said Marino Faliero was so very proud and wrathful,
that he buffeted the Bishop, and almost struck him to the ground: and,
therefore, Heaven allowed Marino Faliero to go out of his right senses,
in order that he might bring himself to an evil death.</p>

<p>When this Duke had held the dukedom during nine months and six days, he,
being wicked and ambitious, sought to make himself Lord of Venice, in
the manner which I have read in an ancient chronicle. When the Thursday
arrived upon which they were wont to hunt the bull, the bull hunt took
place as usual; and, according to the usage of those times, after the
bull hunt had ended, they all proceeded unto the palace of the Duke, and
assembled together in one of his halls; and they disported themselves
with the women. And until the first bell tolled they danced, and then a
banquet was served up. My Lord the Duke paid the expenses thereof,
provided he had a Duchess, and after the banquet they all returned to
their homes.</p>

<p>Now to this feast there came a certain Ser Michele Steno, a gentleman of
poor estate and very young, but crafty and daring, and who loved one of
the damsels of the Duchess. Ser Michele stood amongst the women upon the
solajo; and he behaved indiscreetly, so that my Lord the Duke ordered
that he should be kicked off the solajo [i.e. platform]; and the
esquires of the Duke flung him down from the solajo accordingly. Ser
Michele thought that such an affront was beyond all bearing; and when
the feast was over, and all other persons had left the palace, he,
continuing heated with anger, went to the hall of audience, and wrote
certain unseemly words relating to the Duke and the Duchess upon the
chair in which the Duke was used to sit; for in those days the Duke did
not cover his chair with cloth of sendal, but he sat in a chair of wood.
Ser Michele wrote thereon&mdash;"<i>Marin Falier, the husband of the fair wife;
others kiss her, but he keeps her.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> In the morning the words were
seen, and the matter was considered to be very scandalous; and the
Senate commanded the Avogadori of the Commonwealth to proceed therein
with the greatest diligence. A largess of great amount was immediately
proffered by the Avogadori, in order to discover who had written these
words. And at length it was known that Michele Steno had written them.
It was resolved in the Council of Forty that he should be arrested; and
he then confessed that in the fit of vexation and spite, occasioned by
his being thrust off the solajo in the presence of his mistress, he had
written the words. Therefore the Council debated thereon. And the
Council took his youth into consideration, and that he was a lover; and
therefore they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span> adjudged that he should be kept in close confinement
during two months, and that afterwards he should be banished from Venice
and the state during one year. In consequence of this merciful sentence
the Duke became exceedingly wroth, it appearing to him, that the Council
had not acted in such a manner as was required by the respect due to his
ducal dignity; and he said that they ought to have condemned Ser Michele
to be hanged by the neck, or at least to be banished for life.</p>

<p>Now it was fated that my Lord Duke Marino was to have his head cut off.
And as it is necessary when any effect is to be brought about, that the
cause of such effect must happen, it therefore came to pass, that on the
very day after sentence had been pronounced on Ser Michele Steno, being
the first day of Lent, a gentleman of the house of Barbara, a choleric
gentleman, went to the arsenal, and required certain things of the
masters of the galleys. This he did in the presence of the Admiral of
the arsenal, and he, bearing the request, answered, No, it cannot be
done. High words arose between the gentleman and the Admiral, and the
gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye; and as he
happened to have a ring on his finger, the ring cut the Admiral and drew
blood. The Admiral, all bruised and bloody, ran straight to the Duke to
complain, and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy
punishment upon the gentleman of C&agrave; Barbaro.&mdash;"What wouldst thou have me
do for thee?" answered the Duke: "think upon the shameful gibe which
hath been written concerning me; and think on the manner in which they
have punished that ribald Michele Steno, who wrote it; and see how the
Council of Forty respect our person."&mdash;Upon this the Admiral answered,
"My Lord Duke, if you would wish to make yourself a prince, and to cut
all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces, I have the heart, if you do but
help me, to make you prince of all this state; and then you may punish
them all." Hearing this, the Duke said, "How can such a matter be
brought about?"&mdash;and so they discoursed thereon.</p>

<p>The Duke called for his nephew, Ser Bertuccio Faliero, who lived with
him in the palace, and they communed about this plot. And without
leaving the place, they sent for Philip Calendaro, a seaman of great
repute, and for Bertuccio Israello, who was exceedingly wily and
cunning. Then taking counsel among themselves, they agreed to call in
some others; and so, for several nights successively, they met with the
Duke at home in his palace. And the following men were called in singly;
to wit:&mdash;Niccolo Fagiuolo, Giovanni da Corfu, Stefano Fagiono, Niccolo
dalle Bende, Niccolo Biondo, and Stefano Trivisano.&mdash;It was concerted
that sixteen or seventeen leaders should be stationed in various parts
of the city, each being at the head of forty men, armed and prepared;
but the followers were not to know their destination. On the appointed
day they were to make affrays amongst themselves here and there, in
order that the Duke might have a pretence for tolling the bells of San
Marco; these bells are never rung but by the order of the Duke. And at
the sound of the bells, these sixteen or seventeen, with their
followers, were to come to San Marco, through the streets which open
upon the Piazza. And when the noble and leading citizens should come
into the Piazza, to know the cause of the riot, then the conspirators
were to cut them in pieces; and this work being finished, my Lord Marino
Faliero the Duke was to be proclaimed the Lord of Venice. Things having
been thus settled, they agreed to fulfil their intent on Wednesday, the
15th day of April, in the year 1355. So covertly did they plot, that no
one ever dreamt of their machinations.</p>

<p>But the Lord, who hath always helped this most glorious city, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span> who,
loving its righteousness and holiness, hath never forsaken it, inspired
one Beltramo Bergamasco to be the cause of bringing the plot to light,
in the following manner. This Beltramo, who belonged to Ser Niccolo
Lioni of Santo Stefano, had heard a word or two of what was to take
place; and so, in the above-mentioned month of April, he went to the
house of the aforesaid Ser Niccolo Lioni, and told him all the
particulars of the plot. Ser Niccolo, when he heard all these things,
was struck dead, as it were, with affright. He heard all the
particulars; and Beltramo prayed him to keep it all secret; and if he
told Ser Niccolo, it was in order that Ser Niccolo might stop at home on
the 15th of April, and thus save his life. Beltramo was going, but Ser
Niccolo ordered his servants to lay hands upon him, and lock him up. Ser
Niccolo then went to the house of Messer Giovanni Gradenigo Nasoni, who
afterwards became Duke, and who also lived at Santo Stefano, and told
him all. The matter seemed to him to be of the very greatest importance,
as indeed it was; and they two went to the house of Ser Marco Cornaro,
who lived at San Felice; and, having spoken with him, they all three
then determined to go back to the house of Ser Niccolo Lioni, to examine
the said Beltramo; and having questioned him, and heard all that he had
to say, they left him in confinement. And then they all three went into
the sacristy of San Salvatore, and sent their men to summon the
Councillors, the Avogadori, the Capi de' Dieci, and those of the Great
Council.</p>

<p>When all were assembled, the whole story was told to them. They were
struck dead, as it were, with affright. They determined to send for
Beltramo. He was brought in before them. They examined him, and
ascertained that the matter was true; and, although they were
exceedingly troubled, yet they determined upon their measures. And they
sent for the Capi de' Quarante, the Signori di Notte, the Capi de'
Sestieri, and the Cinque della Pace; and they were ordered to associate
to their men other good men and true, who were to proceed to the houses
of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, and secure them. And they secured
the foreman of the arsenal, in order that the conspirators might not do
mischief. Towards nightfall they assembled in the palace. When they were
assembled in the palace, they caused the gates of the quadrangle of the
palace to be shut. And they sent to the keeper of the Bell-tower, and
forbade the tolling of the bells. All this was carried into effect. The
before-mentioned conspirators were secured, and they were brought to the
palace; and, as the Council of Ten saw that the Duke was in the plot,
they resolved that twenty of the leading men of the state should be
associated to them, for the purpose of consultation and deliberation,
but that they should not be allowed to ballot.</p>

<p>The counsellors were the following:&mdash;Ser Giovanni Mocenigo, of the
Sestiero of San Marco; Ser Almoro Veniero da Santa Marina, of the
Sestiero of Castello; Ser Tomaso Viadro, of the Sestiero of Canaregio;
Ser Giovanni Sanudo, of the Sestiero of Santa Croce; Ser Pietro
Trivisano, of the Sestiero of San Paolo; Ser Pantalione Barbo il Grando,
of the Sestiero of Ossoduro. The Avogadori of the Commonwealth were
Zufredo Morosini, and Ser Orio Pasqualigo; and these did not ballot.
Those of the Council of Ten were Ser Giovanni Marcello, Ser Tomaso
Sanudo, and Ser Micheletto Dolfino, the heads of the aforesaid Council
of Ten. Ser Luca da Legge, and Ser Pietro da Mosto, inquisitors of the
aforesaid Council. And Ser Marco Polani, Ser Marino Veniero, Ser Lando
Lombardo, and Ser Nicoletto Trivisano, of Sant' Angelo.</p>

<p>Late in the night, just before the dawning, they chose a junta of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
twenty noblemen of Venice from amongst the wisest, and the worthiest,
and the oldest. They were to give counsel, but not to ballot. And they
would not admit any one of C&agrave; Faliero. And Niccolo Faliero, and another
Niccolo Faliero, of San Tomaso, were expelled from the Council, because
they belonged to the family of the Doge. And this resolution of creating
the junta of twenty was much praised throughout the state. The following
were the members of the junta of twenty:&mdash;Ser Marco Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Erizzo, Procuratore, Ser Lionardo Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Contarini, Ser Simone Dandolo, Ser Niccolo
Volpe, Ser Giovanni Loredano, Ser Marco Diedo, Ser Giovanni Gradenigo,
Ser Andrea Cornaro Cavaliere, Ser Marco Soranzo, Ser Rinieri du Mosto,
Ser Gazano Marcello, Ser Marino Morosini, Ser Stefano Belegno, Ser
Niccolo Lioni, Ser Filippo Orio, Ser Marco Trivisano, Ser Jacopo
Bragadino, Ser Giovanni Foscarini.</p>

<p>These twenty were accordingly called in to the Council of Ten; and they
sent for my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke: and my Lord Marino was then
consorting in the palace with people of great estate, gentlemen, and
other good men, none of whom knew yet how the fact stood.</p>

<p>At the same time Bertuccio Israello, who, as one of the ringleaders, was
to head the conspirators in Santa Croce, was arrested and bound, and
brought before the Council. Zanello del Brin, Nicoletto di Rosa,
Nicoletto Alberto, and the Guardiaga, were also taken, together with
several seamen, and people of various ranks. These were examined, and
the truth of the plot was ascertained.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April judgment was given in the Council of Ten, that
Filippo Calendaro and Bertuccio Israello should be hanged upon the red
pillars of the balcony of the palace, from which the Duke is wont to
look at the bull hunt: and they were hanged with gags in their mouths.</p>

<p>The next day the following were condemned:&mdash;Niccolo Zuccuolo, Nicoletto
Blondo, Nicoletto Doro, Marco Giuda, Jacomello Dagolino, Nicoletto
Fidele, the son of Filippo Calendaro, Marco Torello, called Israello,
Stefano Trivisano, the money-changer of Santa Margherita, and Antonio
dalle Bende. These were all taken at Chiozza, for they were endeavouring
to escape. Afterwards, by virtue of the sentence which was passed upon
them in the Council of Ten, they were hanged on successive days; some
singly and some in couples, upon the columns of the palace, beginning
from the red columns, and so going onwards towards the canal. And other
prisoners were discharged, because, although they had been involved in
the conspiracy, yet they had not assisted in it; for they were given to
understand by some of the heads of the plot, that they were to come
armed and prepared for the service of the state, and in order to secure
certain criminals; and they knew nothing else. Nicoletto Alberto, the
Guardiaga, and Bartolommeo Ciricolo and his son, and several others, who
were not guilty, were discharged.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 16th day of April, judgment was also given in the
aforesaid Council of Ten, that my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke, should
have his head cut off; and that the execution should be done on the
landing-place of the stone staircase, where the Dukes take their oath
when they first enter the palace. On the following day, the 17th of
April, the doors of the palace being shut, the Duke had his head cut
off, about the hour of noon. And the cap of estate was taken from the
Duke's head before he came down stairs. When the execution was over, it
is said that one of the Council of Ten went to the columns of the palace
over against the place of St. Mark, and that he showed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span> bloody sword
unto the people, crying out with a loud voice&mdash;"The terrible doom hath
fallen upon the traitor!"&mdash;and the doors were opened, and the people all
rushed in, to see the corpse of the Duke, who had been beheaded.</p>

<p>It must be known that Ser Giovanni Sanudo, the councillor, was not
present when the aforesaid sentence was pronounced; because he was
unwell and remained at home. So that only fourteen balloted; that is to
say, five councillors, and nine of the Council of Ten. And it was
adjudged, that all the lands and chattels of the Duke, as well as of the
other traitors, should be forfeited to the state. And as a grace to the
Duke, it was resolved in the Council of Ten, that he should be allowed
to dispose of two thousand ducats out of his own property. And it was
resolved, that all the councillors and all the Avogadori of the
Commonwealth, those of the Council of Ten, and the members of the junta,
who had assisted in passing sentence on the Duke and the other traitors,
should have the privilege of carrying arms both by day and by night in
Venice, and from Grado to Cavazere. And they were also to be allowed two
footmen carrying arms, the aforesaid footmen living and boarding with
them in their own houses. And he who did not keep two footmen might
transfer the privilege to his sons or his brothers; but only to two.
Permission of carrying arms was also granted to the four Notaries of the
Chancery, that is to say, of the Supreme Court, who took the
depositions; and they were, Amedio, Nicoletto di Lorino, Steffanello,
and Pietro de Compostelli, the secretaries of the Signori di Notte.</p>

<p>After the traitors had been hanged, and the Duke had had his head cut
off, the state remained in great tranquillity and peace. And, as I have
read in a Chronicle, the corpse of the Duke was removed in a barge, with
eight torches, to his tomb in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo, where
it was buried. The tomb is now in that aisle in the middle of the little
church of Santa Maria della Pace which was built by Bishop Gabriel of
Bergamo. It is a coffin of stone, with these words engraven thereon:
"<i>Heic jacet Dominus Marinus Faletro Dux.</i>"&mdash;And they did not paint his
portrait in the hall of the Great Council:&mdash;but in the place where it
ought to have been, you see these words:&mdash;"<i>Hic est locus Marini
Faletro, decapitati pro criminibus.</i>"&mdash;And it is thought that his house
was granted to the church of Sant' Apostolo; it was that great one near
the bridge. Yet this could not be the case, or else the family bought it
back from the church; for it still belongs to C&agrave; Faliero. I must not
refrain from noting, that some wished to write the following words in
the place where his portrait ought to have been, as
aforesaid:&mdash;"<i>Marinus Faletro Dux, temeritas me cepit. P&aelig;nas lui,
decapitatus pro criminibus.</i>"&mdash;Others, also, indited a couplet, worthy
of being inscribed upon his tomb.</p>

<p>"Al giovane doge Andrea Dandolo succedette un vecchio, il quale tardi si
pose al timone della repubblica, ma sempre prima di quel, che facea d'
uopo a lui ed alia patria: egli &egrave; Marino Faliero, personaggio a me noto
per antica dimestichezza. Falsa era l' opinione intorno a lui, giacch&egrave;
egli si mostr&ograve; fornito pi&ugrave; di coraggio, che di senno. Non pago della
prima dignit&agrave;, entr&ograve; con sinistro piede nel pubblico Palazzo:
imperciocch&egrave; questo doge dei Veneti, magistrato sacro in tutti i secoli,
che dagli antichi fu sempre venerato qual nume in quella citt&agrave;, l'
altr'jeri fu decollato nel vestibolo dell' istesso Palazzo. Discorrerei
fin dal principio le cause di un tale evento, se cosi vario, ed ambiguo
non ne fosse il grido: nessuno per&ograve; lo scusa, tutti affermano, che egli
abbia voluto cangiar qualche cosa nell' ordine della repubblica a lui
tramandato dai maggiori. Che desiderava egli di pi&ugrave;? Io son d' avviso,
che egli abbia ottenuto ci&ograve;, che non si concedette a nessun altro:
mentre adempiva gli uffici di legato presso il Pontefice, e sulle rive
del Rodano trattava la pace, che io prima di lui avevo indarno tentato
di conchiudere, gli fu conferito l' onore del ducato, che n&egrave; chiedeva,
n&egrave; s' aspettava. Tornato in patria, pens&ograve; a quello, cui nessuno non pose
mente giammai, e soffr&igrave; quello, che a niuno accadde mai di soffrire:
giacch&egrave; in quel luogo celeberrimo, e chiarissimo, e bellissimo infra
tutti quelli, che io vidi, ove i suoi antenati avevano ricevuti
grandissimi onori in mezzo alle pompe trionfali, ivi egli fu trascinato
in modo servile, e spogliato delle insegne ducali, perdette la testa, e
macchi&ograve; col proprio sangue le soglie del tempio, l' atrio del Palazzo, e
le scale marmoree endute spesse volte illustri o dalle solenni
festivit&agrave;, o dalle ostili spoglie. Ho notato il luogo, ora noto il
tempo: &egrave; l' anno del Natale di Cristo, 1355, fu il giorno diciotto
aprile si alto &egrave; il grido sparso, che se alcuno esaminer&agrave; la disciplina,
e le costumanze di quella citt&agrave;, e quanto mutamento di cose venga
minacciato dalla morte di un solo uomo (quantunque molti altri, come
narrano, essendo complici, o subirono l' istesso supplicio, o lo
aspettano) si accorger&agrave;, che nulla di pi&ugrave; grande avvenne ai nostri tempi
nella Italia. Tu forse qui attendi il mio giudizio: assolvo il popolo,
se credere si dee alia fama, bench&egrave; abbia potuto e castigate pi&ugrave;
mitemente, e con maggior dolcezza vendicare il suo dolore: ma non cosi
facilmente, si modera un' ira giusta insieme, e grande in un numeroso
popolo principalmente, nel quale il precipitoso, ed instabile volgo
aguzza gli stimoli dell' iracondia con rapidi, e sconsigliati clamori.
Compatisco, e nell' istesso tempo mi adiro con quell' infelice uomo, il
quale adorno di un' insolito onore, non so, che cosa si volesse negli
estremi anni della sua vita: la calamit&agrave; di lui diviene sempre pi&ugrave;

323-325.</p>

<p>The above Italian translation from the Latin epistles of Petrarch
proves&mdash;1stly, That Marino Faliero was a personal friend of Petrarch's;
"antica dimestichezza," old intimacy, is the phrase of the poet. 2dly,
That Petrarch thought that he had more courage than conduct, "pi&ugrave; di
<i>coraggio</i> che di senno." 3dly, That there was some jealousy on the part
of Petrarch; for he says that Marino Faliero was treating of the peace
which he himself had "vainly attempted to conclude." 4thly, That the
honour of the Dukedom was conferred upon him, which he neither sought
nor expected, "che n&egrave; chiedeva, n&egrave; aspettava," and which had never been
granted to any other in like circumstances, "ci&ograve; che non si concedette a
nessun altro," a proof of the high esteem in which he must have been
held. 5thly, That he had a reputation for <i>wisdom</i>, <i>only</i> forfeited by
the last enterprise of his life, "si usurp&ograve; per tanti anni una falsa
fama di sapienza."&mdash;"He had usurped for so many years a false fame of
wisdom," rather a difficult task, I should think. People are generally
found out before eighty years of age, at least in a republic.&mdash;From
these, and the other historical notes which I have collected, it may be
inferred, that Marino Faliero possessed many of the qualities, but not
the success of a hero; and that his passions were too violent. The
paltry and ignorant account of Dr. Moore falls to the ground. Petrarch
says, "that there had been no greater event in his times" (<i>our times</i>
literally), "nostri tempi," in Italy. He also differs from the historian
in saying that Faliero was "on the banks of the <i>Rhone</i>," instead of at
Rome, when elected; the other accounts say, that the deputation of the
Venetian senate met him at Ravenna. How this may have been, it is not
for me to decide, and is of no great importance. Had the man succeeded,
he would have changed the face of Venice, and perhaps of Italy. As it
is, what <i>are</i> they both?</p>

<p>"To these attacks so frequently pointed by the government against the
clergy,&mdash;to the continual struggles between the different constituted
bodies,&mdash;to these enterprises carried on by the mass of the nobles
against the depositaries of power,&mdash;to all those projects of innovation,
which always ended by a stroke of state policy; we must add a cause not
less fitted to spread contempt for ancient doctrines; <i>this was the
excess of corruption</i>.</p>

<p>"That freedom of manners, which had been long boasted of as the
principal charm of Venetian society, had degenerated into scandalous
licentiousness: the tie of marriage was less sacred in that Catholic
country, than among those nations where the laws and religion admit of
its being dissolved. Because they could not break the contract,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span> they
feigned that it had not existed; and the ground of nullity, immodestly
alleged by the married pair, was admitted with equal facility by priests
and magistrates, alike corrupt. These divorces, veiled under another
name, became so frequent, that the most important act of civil society
was discovered to be amenable to a tribunal of exceptions; and to
restrain the open scandal of such proceedings became the office of the
police. In 1782 the Council of Ten decreed, that every woman who should
sue for a dissolution of her marriage should be compelled to await the
decision of the judges in some convent, to be named by the court.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Soon afterwards the same council summoned all causes of that nature
before itself.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> This infringement on ecclesiastical jurisdiction
having occasioned some remonstrance from Rome, the council retained only
the right of rejecting the petition of the married persons, and
consented to refer such causes to the holy office as it should not
previously have rejected.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>"There was a moment in which, doubtless, the destruction of private
fortunes, the ruin of youth, the domestic discord occasioned by these
abuses, determined the government to depart from its established maxims
concerning the freedom of manners allowed the subject. All the
courtesans were banished from Venice; but their absence was not enough
to reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in
the most scandalous licentiousness. Depravity reached the very bosoms of
private families, and even into the cloister; and they found themselves
obliged to recall, and even to indemnify,<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> women who sometimes
gained possession of important secrets, and who might be usefully
employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them
dangerous. Since that time licentiousness has gone on increasing; and we
have seen mothers, not only selling the innocence of their daughters,
but selling it by a contract, authenticated by the signature of a public
officer, and the performance of which was secured by the protection of
the laws.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>"The parlours of the convents of noble ladies, and the houses of the
courtesans, though the police carefully kept up a number of spies about
them, were the only assemblies for society in Venice; and in these two
places, so different from each other, there was equal freedom. Music,
collations, gallantry, were not more forbidden in the parlours than at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
the casinos. There were a number of casinos for the purpose of public
assemblies, where gaming was the principal pursuit of the company. It
was a strange sight to see persons of either sex masked, or grave in
their magisterial robes, round a table, invoking chance, and giving way
at one instant to the agonies of despair, at the next to the illusions
of hope, and that without uttering a single word.</p>

<p>"The rich had private casinos, but they lived <i>incognito</i> in them; and
the wives whom they abandoned found compensation in the liberty they
enjoyed. The corruption of morals had deprived them of their empire. We
have just reviewed the whole history of Venice, and we have not once
seen them exercise the slightest influence."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daru</span>, <i>Hist. de la R&eacute;pub.

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The author of "Sketches Descriptive of Italy," (1820), etc., one of the
hundred tours lately published, is extremely anxious to disclaim a
possible plagiarism from <i>Childe Harold</i> and <i>Beppo</i>. See p. 159, vol.
iv. He adds that still less could this presumed coincidence arise from
"my conversation," as he had "<i>repeatedly declined an introduction to me
while in Italy</i>."</p>

<p>Who this person may be I know not;<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> but he must have been deceived
by all or any of those who "repeatedly offered to introduce" him, as I
invariably refused to receive any English with whom I was not previously
acquainted, even when they had letters from England. If the whole
assertion is not an invention, I request this person not to sit down
with the notion that he <span class="smcap">could</span> have been introduced, since there has been
nothing I have so carefully avoided as any kind of intercourse with his
countrymen,&mdash;excepting the very few who were for a considerable time
resident in Venice, or had been of my previous acquaintance. Whoever
made him any such offer was possessed of impudence equal to that of
making such an assertion without having had it. The fact is, that I hold
in utter abhorrence any contact with the travelling English, as my
friend the Consul General Hoppner and the Countess Benzoni (in whose
house the Conversazione mostly frequented by them is held), could amply
testify, were it worth while. I was persecuted by these tourists even to
my riding ground at Lido, and reduced to the most disagreeable circuits
to avoid them. At Madame Benzoni's I repeatedly refused to be introduced
to them;&mdash;of a thousand such presentations pressed upon me, I accepted
two, and both were to Irish women.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I should hardly have descended to speak of such trifles publicly, if the
impudence of this "sketcher" had not forced me to a refutation of a
disingenuous and gratuitously impertinent assertion; so meant to be, for
what could it import to the reader to be told that the author "had
repeatedly declined an introduction," even if it had been true, which,
for the reasons I have above given, is scarcely possible. Except Lords
Lansdowne, Jersey, and Lauderdale, Messrs. Scott, Hammond, Sir Humphry
Davy, the late M. Lewis, W. Bankes, Mr. Hoppner, Thomas Moore, Lord
Kinnaird, his brother, Mr. Joy, and Mr. Hobhouse, I do not recollect to
have exchanged a word with another Englishman since I left their
Country; and almost all these I had known before. The others,&mdash;and God
knows there were some hundreds, who bored me with letters or visits, I
refused to have any communication with, and shall be proud and happy
when that wish becomes mutual.</p>

[In the earlier editions (1821-1825) Francis Cohen's translation
(Appendix II.) is preceded by an Italian version (Appendix I.), taken
directly from Muratori's edition of Marin Sanudo's _Vite dei Dogi_
(_Rerum Italicarum Scriptores_, 1733, xii. 628-635). The two versions
are by no means identical. Cohen's "translation" is, presumably an
accurate rendering of Sanudo's text, and must have been made either from
the original MS. or from a transcript sent from Italy to England.
Muratori's Italian is a _rifacimento_ of the original, which has been
altered and condensed with a view to convenience or literary effect.
Proper names of persons and places are changed, Sanudo's Venetian
dialect gives place to Muratori's Italian, and notes which Sanudo added
in the way of illustration and explanation are incorporated in the text.
In the _Life of Marino Faliero_, pp. 199, 200 of the original text are
omitted, and a passage from an old chronicle, which Sanudo gives as a
note, is made to appear part of the original narrative. (See Preface to
_Le Vite dei Dogi di Marin Sanudo_, by G. Monticolo, 1900; _Marino

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE VISION OF JUDGMENT</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Byron's</span> <i>Vision of Judgment</i> is a parody of Southey's <i>Vision of
Judgement</i>.</p>

<p>The acts or fyttes of the quarrel between Byron and Southey occur in the
following order. In the summer of 1817 Southey, accompanied by his
friends, Humphrey Senhouse and the artist Edward Nash, passed some weeks
(July) in Switzerland. They visited Chamouni, and at Montanvert, in the
travellers' album, they found, in Shelley's handwriting, a Greek
hexameter verse, in which he affirmed that he was an "atheist," together
with an indignant comment ("fool!" also in Greek) superadded in an
unknown hand (see <i>Life of Shelley</i>, by E. Dowden, 1886, ii. 30, note).
Southey copied this entry into his note-book, and "spoke of the
circumstance on his return" (circ. August 12, 1817). In the course of
the next year some one told Byron that a rumour had reached England that
he and Shelley "had formed a league of incest with two sisters," and
that Southey and Coleridge were the authors of the scandal. There is
nothing to show through what channel the report of the rumour reached
Byron's ears, but it may be inferred that it was in his mind (see Letter
to Murray, November 24, 1818, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 272) when he assailed
Southey in the "Dedication" ("in good, simple, savage verse") to the
First Canto of <i>Don Juan</i>, which was begun September 6, 1818. Shelley,
who was already embittered against Southey (see the account of a dinner
at Godwin's, November 6, 1817, <i>Diary of H. C. Robinson</i>, 1869, ii. 67),
heard Byron read this "Dedication," and, in a letter to Peacock (October
8, 1818), describes it as being "more like a mixture of wormwood and
verdigrease than satire."</p>

<p>When <i>Don Juan</i> appeared (July 15, 1819), the "Dedication" was not
forthcoming, but of its existence and character Southey had been
informed. "Have you heard," he asks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span> (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill,
<i>Selections from the Letters, etc.</i>, 1856, iii. 142), "that <i>Don Juan</i>
came over with a Dedication to me, in which Lord Castlereagh and I ...
were coupled together for abuse as the 'two Roberts'? A fear of
persecution (<i>sic</i>) from the <i>one</i> Robert is supposed to be the reason
why it has been suppressed. Lord Byron might have done well to remember
that the other can write dedications also; and make his own cause good,
if it were needful, in prose or rhyme, against a villain, as well as
against a slanderer."</p>

<p>When George III. died (January 29, 1820), it became the duty of the
"laurel-honouring laureate" to write a funeral ode, and in composing a
Preface, in vindication of the English hexameter, he took occasion
"incidentally to repay some of his obligations to Lord Byron by a few
comments on <i>Don Juan</i>" (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill, January 8, 1821,
<i>Selections, etc.</i>, iii. 225). He was, no doubt, impelled by other and
higher motives to constitute himself a <i>censor morum</i>, and take up his
parable against the spirit of the age as displayed and fostered in <i>Don
Juan</i> (see a letter to Wynne, March 23, 1821, <i>Selections, etc.</i>, iii.
238), but the suppressed "Dedication" and certain gibes, which had been
suffered to appear, may be reckoned as the immediate causes of his
anathema.</p>

<p>Southey's <i>Vision of Judgement</i> was published April 11, 1821&mdash;an
undivine comedy, in which the apotheosis of George III., the
beatification of the virtuous, and the bale and damnation of such
egregious spirits as Robespierre, Wilkes, and Junius, are "thrown upon
the screen" of the showman or lecturer. Southey said that the "Vision"
ought to be read aloud, and, if the subject could be forgotten and
ignored, the hexameters might not sound amiss, but the subject and its
treatment are impossible and intolerable. The "Vision" would have "made
sport" for Byron in any case, but, in the Preface, Southey went out of
his way to attack and denounce the anonymous author of <i>Don Juan</i>.</p>

<p>"What, then," he asks (ed. 1838, x. 204), "should be said of those for
whom the thoughtlessness and inebriety of wanton youth can no longer be
pleaded, but who have written in sober manhood, and with deliberate
purpose?... Men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations, who,
forming a system of opinions to suit their own unhappy course of
conduct, have rebelled against the holiest ordinances of human society,
and hating that revealed religion which, with all their efforts and
bravadoes, they are unable entirely to disbelieve, labour to make others
as miserable as themselves, by infecting them with a moral virus that
eats into the soul! The school which they have set up may properly be
called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span> the Satanic school; for, though their productions breathe the
spirit of Belial in their lascivious parts, and the spirit of Moloch in
those loathsome images of atrocities and horrors which they delight to
represent, they are more especially characterized by a Satanic pride and
audacious impiety, which still betrays the wretched feeling of
hopelessness wherewith it is allied."</p>

<p>Byron was not slow to take up the challenge. In the "Appendix" to the
<i>Two Foscari</i> (first ed., pp. 325-329), which was written at Ravenna,
June-July, but not published till December 11, 1821, he retaliates on
"Mr. Southey and his 'pious preface'" in many words; but when it comes
to the point, ignores the charge of having "published a lascivious
book," and endeavours by counter-charges to divert the odium and to
cover his adversary with shame and confusion. "Mr. S.," he says, "with a
cowardly ferocity, exults over the anticipated 'death-bed repentance' of
the objects of his dislike; and indulges himself in a pleasant 'Vision
of Judgment,' in prose as well as verse, full of impious impudence.... I
am not ignorant," he adds, "of Mr. Southey's calumnies on a different
occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his
return from Switzerland against me and others.... What <i>his</i> 'death-bed'
may be it is not my province to predicate; let him settle it with his
Maker, as I must do with mine. There is something at once ludicrous and
blasphemous in this arrogant scribbler of all works sitting down to deal
damnation and destruction upon his fellow-creatures, with Wat Tyler, the
Apotheosis of George the Third, and the Elegy on Martin the regicide,
all shuffled together in his writing-desk."</p>

<p>Southey must have received his copy of the <i>Two Foscari</i> in the last
week of December, 1821, and with the "Appendix" (to say nothing of the
Third Canto of <i>Don Juan</i>) before him, he gave tongue, in the pages of
the <i>Courier</i>, January 6, 1822. His task was an easy one. He was able to
deny, <i>in toto</i>, the charge of uttering calumnies on his return from
Switzerland, and he was pleased to word his denial in a very
disagreeable way. He had come home with a stock of travellers' tales,
but not one of them was about Lord Byron. He had "sought for no staler
subject than St. Ursula." His charges of "impiety," "lewdness,"
"profanation," and "pollution," had not been answered, and were
unanswerable; and as to his being a "scribbler of all work," there were
exceptions&mdash;works which he had <i>not</i> scribbled, the <i>nefanda</i> which
disfigured the writings of Lord Byron. "Satanic school" would stick.</p>

<p>So far, the battle went in Southey's favour. "The words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span> of the men of
Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel," and Byron was
reduced to silence. A challenge (sent through Kinnaird, but not
delivered) was but a confession of impotence. There was, however, in
Southey's letter to the <i>Courier</i> just one sentence too many. Before he
concluded he had given "one word of advice to Lord Byron"&mdash;"When he
attacks me again, let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command
of himself, it will be a great advantage that his temper should be
obliged to <i>keep tune</i>."</p>

<p>Byron had anticipated this advice, and had already attacked the laureate
in rhyme, scornfully and satirically, but with a gay and genial mockery
which dispensed with "wormwood and verdigrease" or yet bitterer and more
venomous ingredients.</p>

<p>There was a truth in Lamb's jest, that it was Southey's <i>Vision of
Judgement</i> which was worthy of prosecution; that "Lord Byron's poem was
of a most good-natured description&mdash;no malevolence" (<i>Diary of H. C.
Robinson</i>, 1869, ii. 240). Good-natured or otherwise, it awoke
inextinguishable laughter, and left Byron in possession of the field.</p>

<p>The <i>Vision of Judgment</i>, begun May 7 (but probably laid aside till
September 11), was forwarded to Murray October 4, 1821. "By this post,"
he wrote to Moore, October 6, 1821 (<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 387), "I have
sent my nightmare to balance the incubus of Southey's impudent
anticipation of the Apotheosis of George the Third." A chance perusal of
Southey's letter in the <i>Courier</i> (see Medwin's <i>Conversations</i>, 1824,
p. 222, and letters to Douglas Kinnaird, February 6, 25, 1822) quickened
his desire for publication; but in spite of many appeals and suggestions
to Murray, who had sent Byron's "copy" to his printer, the decisive step
of passing the proofs for press was never taken. At length Byron lost
patience, and desired Murray to hand over "the corrected copy of the
proof with the Preface" of the <i>Vision of Judgment</i> to John Hunt (see
letters to Murray, July 3, 6, 1822, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 92, 93).
Finally, a year after the MS. had been sent to England, the <i>Vision of
Judgment</i>, by Quevedo Redivivus, appeared in the first number (pp. 1-39)
of the <i>Liberal</i>, which was issued October 15, 1822. The Preface, to
Byron's astonishment and annoyance, was not forthcoming (see letter to
Murray, October 22, 1822, <i>Letters</i>, 1901, vi. 126, and <i>Examiner</i>,
Sunday, November 3, 1822, p. 697), and is not prefixed to the first
issue of the <i>Vision of Judgment</i> in the first number of the <i>Liberal</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Liberal</i> was severely handled by the press (see, for example, the
<i>Literary Gazette</i> for October 19, 26, November 2, 1822; see, too, an
anonymous pamphlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span> entitled <i>A Critique on the "Liberal"</i> (London,
1822, 8vo, 16 pages), which devotes ten pages to an attack on the
<i>Vision of Judgment</i>). The daily press was even more violent. The
<i>Courier</i> for October 26 begins thus: "This <i>scoundrel-like</i> publication
has at length made its appearance."</p>

<p>There was even a threat of prosecution. Byron offered to employ counsel
for Hunt, to come over to England to stand his trial in his stead, and
blamed Murray for not having handed over the corrected proof, in which
some of the more offensive passages had been omitted or mitigated (see
letter to Murray, December 25, 1822, and letter to John Hunt, January 8,
1823, <i>Letters,</i> 1901, vi. 155, 159). It is to be noted that in the list
of <i>Errata</i> affixed to the table of Contents at the end of the first
volume of the <i>Liberal,</i> the words, a "weaker king ne'er," are
substituted for "a worse king never" (stanza viii. line 6), and "an
unhandsome woman" for "a bad, ugly woman" (stanza xii. line 8). It would
seem that these emendations, which do not appear in the MS., were
slipped into the <i>Errata</i> as precautions, not as after-thoughts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was held that a publication "calumniating the late
king, and wounding the feelings of his present Majesty," was a danger to
the public peace, and on January 15, 1824, the case of the King <i>v.</i>
John Hunt was tried in the Court of King's Bench. The jury brought in a
verdict of "Guilty," but judgment was deferred, and it was not till July
19, 1824, three days after the author of the <i>Vision of Judgment</i> had
been laid to rest at Hucknall Torkard, that the publisher was sentenced
to pay to the king a fine of one hundred pounds, and to enter into
securities, for five years, for a larger amount.</p>

<p class="attrib">[POPE'S <i>Essay on Criticism</i>, line 625.]</p>

<p>If Mr. Southey had not rushed in where he had no business, and where he
never was before, and never will be again, the following poem would not
have been written. It is not impossible that it may be as good as his
own, seeing that it cannot, by any species of stupidity, natural or
acquired, be <i>worse.</i> The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the
renegade intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem by the author of
"Wat Tyler," are something so stupendous as to form the sublime of
himself&mdash;containing the quintessence of his own attributes.</p>

<p>So much for his poem&mdash;a word on his preface. In this preface it has
pleased the magnanimous Laureate to draw the picture of a supposed
"Satanic School," the which he doth recommend to the notice of the
legislature; thereby adding to his other laurels the ambition of those
of an informer. If there exists anywhere, except in his imagination,
such a School, is he not sufficiently armed against it by his own
intense vanity? The truth is that there are certain writers whom Mr. S.
imagines, like Scrub, to have "talked of <i>him</i>; for they laughed
consumedly."<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>I think I know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to
allude, to assert, that they, in their individual capacities, have done
more good, in the charities of life, to their fellow-creatures, in any
one year, than Mr. Southey has done harm to himself by his absurdities
in his whole life; and this is saying a great deal. But I have a few
questions to ask.</p>

<p>1stly, Is Mr. Southey the author of <i>Wat Tyler</i>?</p>

<p>2ndly, Was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his
beloved England, because it was a blasphemous and seditious
publication?<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>3rdly, Was he not entitled by William Smith, in full parliament, "a
rancorous renegado?"<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>4thly, Is he not poet laureate, with his own lines on Martin the
regicide staring him in the face?<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>And, 5thly, Putting the four preceding items together, with what
conscience dare <i>he</i> call the attention of the laws to the publications
of others, be they what they may?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>I say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding; its meanness speaks
for itself; but I wish to touch upon the <i>motive</i>, which is neither more
nor less than that Mr. S. has been laughed at a little in some recent
publications, as he was of yore in the <i>Anti-jacobin</i>, by his present
patrons. Hence all this "skimble scamble stuff" about "Satanic," and so
forth. However, it is worthy of him&mdash;"<i>qualis ab incepto</i>."</p>

<p>If there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of
the public in the following poem, they may thank Mr. Southey. He might
have written hexameters, as he has written everything else, for aught
that the writer cared&mdash;had they been upon another subject. But to
attempt to canonise a monarch, who, whatever were his household virtues,
was neither a successful nor a patriot king,&mdash;inasmuch as several years
of his reign passed in war with America and Ireland, to say nothing of
the aggression upon France&mdash;like all other exaggeration, necessarily
begets opposition. In whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new
<i>Vision</i>, his <i>public</i> career will not be more favourably transmitted by
history. Of his private virtues (although a little expensive to the
nation) there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>With regard to the supernatural personages treated of, I can only say
that I know as much about them, and (as an honest man) have a better
right to talk of them than Robert Southey. I have also treated them more
tolerantly. The way in which that poor insane creature, the Laureate,
deals about his judgments in the next world, is like his own judgment in
this. If it was not completely ludicrous, it would be something worse. I
don't think that there is much more to say at present.</p>

<p class="attrib">QUEVEDO REDIVIVUS.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;It is possible that some readers may object, in these
objectionable times, to the freedom with which saints, angels, and
spiritual persons discourse in this <i>Vision</i>. But, for precedents upon
such points, I must refer him to Fielding's <i>Journey from this World to
the next</i>, and to the Visions of myself, the said Quevedo, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span> Spanish
or translated.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The reader is also requested to observe, that no
doctrinal tenets are insisted upon or discussed; that the person of the
Deity is carefully withheld from sight, which is more than can be said
for the Laureate, who hath thought proper to make him talk, not "like a
school-divine,"<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> but like the unscholarlike Mr. Southey. The whole
action passes on the outside of heaven; and Chaucer's <i>Wife of Bath</i>,
Pulci's <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, Swift's <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, and the other
works above referred to, are cases in point of the freedom with which
saints, etc., may be permitted to converse in works not intended to be
serious.</p>

<p class="attrib">Q.R.</p>

<p>* * * Mr. Southey being, as he says, a good Christian and vindictive,
threatens, I understand, a reply to this our answer. It is to be hoped
that his visionary faculties will in the meantime have acquired a little
more judgment, properly so called: otherwise he will get himself into
new dilemmas. These apostate jacobins furnish rich rejoinders. Let him
take a specimen. Mr. Southey laudeth grievously "one Mr. Landor,"<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
who cultivates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
much private renown in the shape of Latin verses; and
not long ago, the poet laureate dedicated to him, it appeareth, one of
his fugitive lyrics, upon the strength of a poem called "<i>Gebir</i>." Who
could suppose, that in this same Gebir the aforesaid Savage Landor (for
such is his grim cognomen) putteth into the infernal regions no less a
person than the hero of his friend Mr. Southey's heaven,&mdash;yea, even
George the Third! See also how personal Savage becometh, when he hath a
mind. The following is his portrait of our late gracious sovereign:&mdash;</p>

<p>I omit noticing some edifying Ithyphallics of Savagius, wishing to keep
the proper veil over them, if his grave but somewhat indiscreet
worshipper will suffer it; but certainly these teachers of "great moral

<span class="label">[498]</span></a> [Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) had recently published
a volume of Latin poems (<i>Idyllia Heroica Decem. Librum Phaleuciorum
Unum</i>. Partim jam primum Partim iterum atque tertio edit Savagius
Landor. Accedit Qu&aelig;stiuncula cur Poet&aelig; Latini Recentiores minus
leguntur, Pisis, 1820, 410). In his Preface to the <i>Vision of
Judgement</i>, Southey illustrates his denunciation of "Men of diseased
hearts," etc. (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_476">p. 476</a>), by a quotation from the Latin
essay: "Summi poet&aelig; in omni poetarum s&aelig;culo viri fuerunt probi: in
nostris id vidimus et videmus; neque alius est error a veritate longi&ugrave;s
qu&agrave;m magna ingenia magnis necessario corrumpi vitiis," etc. (<i>Idyllia</i>,
p. 197). It was a cardinal maxim of the Lake School "that there can be
no great poet who is not a good man.... His heart must be pure" (see
Table Talk, by S. T. Coleridge, August 20, 1833); and Landor's testimony
was welcome and consolatory. "Of its author," he adds, "I will only say
in this place, that, to have obtained his approbation as a poet, and
possessed his friendship as a man, will be remembered among the honours
of my life." Now, apart from the essay and its evident application,
Byron had probably observed that among the <i>Phaleucia</i>, or
Hendecasyllables, were included some exquisite lines <i>Ad Sutheium</i> (on
the death of Herbert Southey), followed by some extremely unpleasant
ones on <i>Taunto</i> and his tongue, and would naturally conclude that
"Savagius" was ready to do battle for the Laureate if occasion arose.
Hence the side issue. With regard to the "Ithyphallics," there are
portions of the Latin poems (afterwards expunged, see <i>Poemata et
Inscriptiones</i>, Moxon, 1847) included in the Pisa volume which might
warrant the description; but from a note to <i>The Island</i> (Canto II.
stanza xvii. line 10) it may be inferred that some earlier collection of
Latin verses had come under Byron's notice. For Landor's various
estimates of Byron's works and genius, see <i>Works</i>, 1876, iv. 44-46, 88,
89, etc.]</p></div>

In Hogarth's caricature (the original pen-and-ink sketch is in the

Wilkes squints more than "a gentleman should squint." The costume&mdash;long
coat, waistcoat buttoned to the neck, knee-breeches, and stockings&mdash;is
not unpleasing, but the expression of the face is something between a
leer and a sneer. Walpole (<i>Letters</i>, 1858, vii. 274) describes another
portrait (by Zoffani) as "a delightful piece of Wilkes looking&mdash;no,
squinting tenderly at his daughter. It is a caricature of the Devil

Grafton, a half-hearted friend. The duke (1736-1811) would have visited
him in the Tower (1763), "to hear from himself his own story and his
defence;" but rejected an appeal which Wilkes addressed to him (May 3)
to become surety for bail. He feared that such a step might "come under
the denomination of an insult on the Crown." A writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>
(see line 8) was applied for by Lord Temple and others, and, May 6,
Wilkes was discharged by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, on the ground of
privilege. Three years later (November 1, 1766), on his return from
Italy, Wilkes sought to obtain Grafton's protection and interest; but
the duke, though he consulted Chatham, and laid Wilkes's letter before
the King, decided to "take no notice" of this second appeal. In his
<i>Autobiography</i> Grafton is careful to define "the extent of his
knowledge" of Mr. Wilkes, and to explain that he was not "one of his
intimates"&mdash;a <i>caveat</i> which warrants the statement of Junius that "as
for Mr. Wilkes, it is, perhaps, the greatest misfortune of his life,
that you should have so many compensations to make in the closet for
your former friendship with him. Your gracious Master understands your
character; and makes you a persecutor because you have been a friend"

than fifty authors. Among the more famous are the Duke of Portland, Lord
George Sackville, Sir Philip Francis, Edmund Burke, John Dunning, Lord
Ashburton, John Home Tooke, Hugh Boyd, George Chalmers, etc. Of Junius,
Byron wrote, in his <i>Journal</i> of November 23, 1813, "I don't know what
to think. Why should Junius be yet dead?.... the man must be alive, and
will never die without the disclosure" (<i>Letters</i>, 1893, ii. 334); but
an article (by Brougham) in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, vol. xxix. p. 94, on
<i>The Identity of Junius with a Distinguished Living Character
established</i> (see <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 210), seems to have almost
persuaded him that "Francis is Junius." (For a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the arguments
in favour of the identity of Junius with Francis, see Mr. Leslie
Stephen's article in the <i>Dict. of Nat. Biography</i>, art. "Francis." See,
too, <i>History of England in the Eighteenth Century</i>, by W. E. H. Lecky,
1887, iii. 233-255. For a series of articles (by W. Fraser Rae) against
this theory, see <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, 1888, ii. 192, 258, 319. The question is
still being debated. See <i>The Francis Letters</i>, with a note on the

said, that "had he been consulted at the creation of the world, he would
have spared the Maker some absurdities. [Alphonso X., King of Castile
(1221-1284), surnamed the Wise and the Astronomer, "gave no small
encouragement to the Jewish rabbis." Under his patronage Judah de Toledo
translated the works of Avicenna, and improved them by a new division of
the stars. Moreover, "he sent for about 50 learned men from Gascony,
Paris, and other places, to translate the tables of Ptolemy, and to
compile a more correct set of them (i.e. the famous <i>Tabul&aelig; Alphonsin&aelig;</i>)
... The king himself presided over the assembly."&mdash;<i>Mod. Univ. Hist.</i>,
xiii. 304, 305, note(U).
</p><p>
Alfonso has left behind him the reputation of a Castilian
Hamlet&mdash;"infinite in faculty," but "unpregnant of his cause." "He was
more fit," says Mariana (<i>Hist.</i>, lib. xiii. c. 20), "for letters than
for the government of his subjects; he studied the heavens and watched
the stars, but forgot the earth and lost his kingdom." Nevertheless his
works do follow him. "He is to be remembered for his poetry
(<i>'C&aacute;ntigas'</i>, chants in honour of the Virgin, and <i>'Tesoro'</i> a treatise
on the philosopher's stone), for his astronomical tables, which all the
progress of science have not deprived of their value, and for his great
work on legislation, which is at this moment an authority in both
hemispheres."&mdash;<i>Hist. of Spanish Literature</i>, by G. Ticknor, 1888, i. 7.
</p><p>
Byron got the quip about Alfonso and "the absurdities of creation" from
Bayle (<i>Dict</i>., 1735, art. "Castile"), who devotes a long note (H) to a
somewhat mischievous apology for the king's apparent profanity. Bayle's
immediate authority is Le Bovier de Fontenelle, in his <i>Entretiens sur
la Pluralit&eacute; des Mondes</i>, 1686, p. 38, "L'embaras de tous ces cercles
estoit si grand, que dans un temps o&ugrave; l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de

<span class="label">[568]</span></a> <a id="Note_529"></a>{529}[Byron does not give his authority for the Spanish
original of his <i>Romance Muy Doloroso</i>. In default of any definite
information, it may be surmised that his fancy was caught by some
broadside or chap-book which chanced to come into his possession, and
that he made his translation without troubling himself about the origin
or composition of the ballad. As it stands, the "Romance" is a cento of
three or more ballads which are included in the <i>Guerras Civiles de
Granada</i> of Gin&egrave;s Perez de Hita, published at Saragossa in 1595 (see ed.
"En Alcala de Henares," 1601, pp. 249-252). Stanzas 1-11, "Passeavase el
Rey Moro," etc., follow the text which De Hita gives as a translation
from the Arabic; stanzas 12-14 are additional, and do not correspond
with any of the Spanish originals; stanzas 15-21, with numerous
deviations and omissions, follow the text of a second ballad, "Moro
Alcayde, Moro Alcayde," described by De Hita as "antiguo Romance," and
portions of stanzas 21-23 are imbedded in a ballad entitled "Muerte dada
&aacute; Los Abencerrajes" (Duran's <i>Romancero General</i>, 1851, ii. 89).
</p><p>
The ballad as a whole was not known to students of Spanish literature
previous to the publication of Byron's translation (1818), (see <i>Ancient
Ballads from the Civil Wars of Granada</i>, by Thomas Rodd, 1801, pp. 93,
98; Southey's <i>Common-Place Book</i>, iv. 262-266, and his <i>Chronicle of
the Cid</i>, 1808, pp. 371-374), and it has not been included by H. Duran
in his <i>Romancero General</i>, 1851, ii. 89-91, or by F. Wolf and C.
Hofmann in their <i>Primavera y Flor de Romances</i>, 1856, i. 270-278. At
the same time, it is most improbable that Byron was his own
"Centonista," and it may be assumed that the Spanish text as printed
(see <i>Childe Harold,</i> Canto IV., 1818, pp. 240-254, and <i>Poetical
Works</i>, 1891, pp. 566, 567) was in his possession or within his reach.
(For a correspondence on the subject, see <i>Notes and Queries</i>, Third
Series, vol. xii. p. 391, and Fourth Series, vol. i. p. 162.)
</p><p>
A MS. of the Spanish text, sent to England for "copy," is in a foreign
handwriting. Two MSS. (A, B) of the translation are in Mr. Murray's
possession: A, a rough draft; B, a fair copy. The watermark of A is
1808, of B (dated January 4, 1817) 1800. It is to be noted that the
refrain in the Spanish text is <i>Ay de mi Alhama</i>, and that the insertion
of the comma is a printer's or reader's error.]</p></div>

an incitement to grief and despair, and for this reason it was at length

De Hita's work is not at all probable. "He may have obtained Arabic

office as a subordinate in the Ministry of Education at Milan, and was
elected a member of the college of "Dotti." At a later period of his
life he returned to Bassano, and received an appointment as censor of
the press. His poetry, which is sweet and musical, but lacking in force
and substance, recalls and embodies the style and spirit of the dying
literature of the eighteenth century. "He lived and died," says Luigi
Carrer, "the poet of Irene and Dori," unmoved by the hopes and fears,

<span class="label">[579]</span></a> [Lady Blessington told Crabb Robinson (Diary, 1869, in.
17) that the publication of the <i>Question and Answer</i> would "kill
Rogers." The MS. is dated 1818, and it is probable that the lines were
written in the early spring of that year. Moore or Murray had told Byron
that Rogers was in doubt whether to praise or blame him in his poem on
"Human Life" now approaching completion; and he had heard, from other
sources, that it was Rogers who was the author or retailer of certain
scandalous stories which were current in the "whispering-gallery of the
world." He had reason to believe that everybody was talking about him,
and it was a relief to be able to catch and punish so eminent a
scandal-monger. It was in this spirit that he wrote to Murray (February
20, 1818), "What you tell me of Rogers, ... is like him. He cannot say
that I have not been a sincere and warm friend to him, till the black
drop of his liver oozed through too palpably to be overlooked. Now if I
once catch him at any of his jugglery with me or mine, let him look to
it," etc., etc., and in all probability the "poem on Rogers" was then in
existence, or was working in his brain. The lines once written, Byron
swallowed his venom, and, when Rogers visited Italy in the autumn of
1821, he met him at Bologna, travelled with him across the Apennines to
Florence, and invited him "to stay as long as he liked" at Pisa. Thither
Rogers came, presumably, in November, 1821, and, if we may trust the
<i>Table Talk</i> (1856, p. 238), remained at the Palazzo Lanfranchi for
several days.
</p><p>
Byron seems to have been more than usually provocative and
cross-grained, and, on one occasion (see Medwin, <i>Angler in Wales</i>,
1834, i. 26, <i>sq</i>.; and <i>Records of Shelley, etc</i>., by E. T. Trelawney,
1878, i. 53), when he was playing billiards, and Rogers was in the lobby
outside, secretly incited his bull-dog, "Faithful Moretto," to bark and
show his teeth; and, when Medwin had convoyed the terror-stricken bard
into his presence, greeted him with effusion, but contrived that he
should sit down on the very sofa which hid from view the MS. of
"Question and Answer." <i>Longa est injuria, long&aelig; ambages</i>; but the story
rests on the evidence of independent witnesses.
</p><p>
By far the best comment on satire and satirist is to be found in the
noble lines in <i>Italy</i>, in which Rogers commemorates his last meeting
with the "Youth who swam from Sestos to Abydos"&mdash;

between two of their ancestors, D[ominus] B[yron] and Mr. C., January
26, 1765.
</p><p>
Byron and Mary Anne Chaworth were fourth cousins, both being fifth in
descent from George, Viscount Chaworth, whose daughter Elizabeth was
married to William, third Lord Byron (d. 1695), the poet's
great-great-grandfather. The duel between their grand-uncles, William,
fifth Lord Byron, and William Chaworth, Esq., of Annesley, was fought
between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of Saturday, January 26,
1765 (see <i>The Gazetteer</i>, Monday, January 28, 1765), at the Star and
Garter Tavern, Pall Mall. The coroner's jury brought in a verdict of
wilful murder (see for the "Inquisition," and report of trial, <i>Journals
of the House of Lords</i>, 1765, pp. 49, 126-135), and on the presentation
of their testimony to the House of Lords, Byron pleaded for a trial "by
God and his peers," whereupon he was arrested and sent to the Tower. The
case was tried by the Lords Temporal (the Lords Spiritual asked
permission to withdraw), and, after a defence had been read by the
prisoner, 119 peers brought in a verdict of "Not guilty of murder,
guilty of manslaughter, on my honour." Four peers only returned a
verdict of "Not guilty." The result of this verdict was that Lord Byron
claimed the benefit of the statute of Edward VI., and was discharged on
paying the fees.
</p><p>
The defence, which is given in full (see Journal, etc., for April 17,
1765), is able and convincing. Whilst maintaining an air of chivalry and
candour, the accused contrived to throw the onus of criminality on his
antagonist. It was Mr. Chaworth who began the quarrel, by sneering at
his cousin's absurd and disastrous leniency towards poachers. It was
Chaworth who insisted on an interview, not on the stairs, but in a
private room, who locked the door, and whose demeanour made a challenge
"to draw" inevitable. The room was dimly lit, and when the table was
pushed back, the space for the combatants was but twelve feet by five.
After two thrusts had been parried, and Lord Byron's shirt had been
torn, he shifted a little to the right, to take advantage of such light
as there was, came to close quarters with his adversary and, "as he
supposed, gave the unlucky wound which he would ever reflect upon with
the utmost regret."
</p><p>
If there was any truth in his plea, the "wicked Lord Byron" has been
misjudged, and, at least in the matter of the duel, was not so black as
he has been painted. For Byron's defence of his grand-uncle, see letter
to M. J. J. Coulmann, Genoa, July 12, 1823, <i>Life</i>, by Karl Elze, 1872,
pp. 443-446.]</p></div>

<span class="label">[588]</span></a> <a id="Note_545"></a>{545} [There has been some misunderstanding with regard to
this poem. According to the statement of the Countess Guiccioli (see
<i>Works of Lord Byron</i>, ed. 1832, xii. 14), "Stanzas to the Po" were
composed about the middle of April, 1819, "while Lord Byron was actually
sailing on the Po," <i>en route</i> from Venice to Ravenna. Medwin, who was
the first to publish the lines (<i>Conversations, etc.</i>, 1824, 410, pp.
24-26), says that they were written when Byron was about to "quit Venice
to join" the Countess at Ravenna, and, in a footnote, explains that the
river referred to is the Po. Now, if the Countess and Medwin (and Moore,
who follows Medwin, <i>Life</i>, p. 396) are right, and the river is the Po,
the "ancient walls" Ravenna, and the "Lady of the land" the Guiccioli,
the stanzas may have been written in June (not April), 1819, possibly at
Ferrara, and the river must be the Po di Primaro. Even so, the first
line of the first stanza and the third and fourth lines of the ninth
stanza require explanation. The Po does not "roll by the ancient walls"
of Ravenna; and how could Byron be at one and the same time "by the
source" (stanza 9, line 4), and sailing on the river, or on some
canalized tributary or effluent? Be the explanation what it may&mdash;and it
is possible that the lines were <i>not</i> originally designed for the
Countess, but for another "Lady of the land" (see letter to Murray, May
18, 1819)&mdash;it may be surmised that "the lines written last year on
crossing the Po," the "mere verses of society," which were given to
Kinnaird (see letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, and <i>Conversations of Lord
Byron with Lady Blessington</i>, 1834, p. 143), were not the sombre though
passionate elegy, "River, that rollest," but the bitter and somewhat
cynical rhymes, "Could Love for ever, Run like a river"
(<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_549">p. 549</a>).]</p></div>

Ravenna when he wrote these stanzas, says, They were composed, like many
others, with no view of publication, but merely to relieve himself in a
moment of suffering. He had been painfully excited by some circumstances
which appeared to make it necessary that he should immediately quit
Italy; and in the day and the hour that he wrote the song was labouring
under an access of fever" (<i>Works</i>, 1832, xii. 317, note 1). Here, too,
there is some confusion of dates and places. Byron was at Venice, not at
Ravenna, December 1, 1819, when these lines were composed. They were
sent, as Lady Blessington testifies, to Kinnaird, and are probably
identical with the "mere verses of society," mentioned in the letter to
Murray of May 8, 1820. The last stanza reflects the mood of a letter to
the Countess Guiccioli, dated November 25 (1819), "I go to save you, and
leave a country insupportable to me without you" (<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv.
379, note 2).]</p></div>

<span class="label">[592]</span></a> [A few days before Byron enclosed these lines in a letter
to Moore (September 17, 1821) he had written to Murray (September 12):
"If ever I <i>do</i> return to England ... I will write a poem to which
<i>English Bards, etc.</i>, shall be New Milk, in comparison. Your present
literary world of mountebanks stands in need of such an Avatar." Hence
the somewhat ambiguous title. The word "Avatar" is not only applied
ironically to George IV. as the "Messiah of Royalty," but metaphorically
to the poem, which would descend in the "Capacity of Preserver" (see Sir
W. Jones, <i>Asiatic Research</i>, i. 234).
</p><p>
The "fury" which sent Byron into this "lawless conscription of
rhythmus," was inspired partly by an ungenerous attack on Moore, which
appeared in the pages of <i>John Bull</i> ("Thomas Moore is not likely to
fall in the way of knighthood ... being public defaulter in his office
to a large amount.... [August 5]. It is true that we cannot from
principle esteem the writer of the <i>Twopenny Postbag</i>.... It is equally
true that we shrink from the profligacy," etc., August 12, 1821); and,
partly, by the servility of the Irish, who had welcomed George IV. with
an outburst of enthusiastic loyalty, when he entered Dublin in triumph
within ten days of the death of Queen Caroline. The <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
August 8-August 18, 1821, prints effusive leading articles, edged with
black borders, on the Queen's illness, death, funeral procession, etc.,
over against a column (in small type) headed "The King in Dublin."
Byron's satire is a running comment on the pages of the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>. Moore was in Paris at the time, being, as <i>John Bull</i> said,
"obliged to live out of England," and Byron gave him directions that
twenty copies of the <i>Irish Avatar</i> "should be carefully and privately
printed off." Medwin says that Byron gave him "a printed copy," but his
version (see <i>Conversations</i>, 1824, pp. 332-338), doubtless for
prudential reasons, omits twelve of the more libellous stanzas. The poem
as a whole was not published in England till 1831, when "George the
despised" was gone to his account. According to Crabb Robinson (<i>Diary</i>,
1869, ii. 437), Goethe said that "Byron's verses on George IV. (<i>Query?
The Irish Avatar</i>) were the sublime of hatred."]</p></div>

and with Mitford's <i>Greece</i> (<i>Don Juan</i>, Canto

thought expressed in lines 5-11 was, possibly, suggested by Coleridge's
translation of the famous passage in Schiller's <i>Piccolomini</i> (act ii.

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE BLUES</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Byron's</span> correspondence does not explain the mood in which he wrote <i>The
Blues</i>, or afford the slightest hint or clue to its <i>motif</i> or occasion.
In a letter to Murray, dated Ravenna, August 7, 1821, he writes, "I send
you a thing which I scribbled off yesterday, a mere buffoonery, to quiz
'The Blues.' If published it must be <i>anonymously</i>.... You may send me a
proof if you think it worth the trouble." Six weeks later, September 20,
he had changed his mind. "You need not," he says, "send <i>The Blues</i>,
which is a mere buffoonery not meant for publication." With these
intimations our knowledge ends, and there is nothing to show why in
August, 1821, he took it into his head "to quiz The Blues," or why,
being so minded, he thought it worth while to quiz them in so pointless
and belated a fashion. We can but guess that an allusion in a letter
from England, an incident at a conversazione at Ravenna, or perhaps the
dialogues in Peacock's novels, <i>Melincourt</i> and <i>Nightmare Abbey</i>,
brought to his recollection the half-modish, half-literary coteries of
the earlier years of the Regency, and that he sketches the scenes and
persons of his eclogue not from life, but from memory.</p>

<p>In the Diary of 1813, 1814, there is more than one mention of the
"Blues." For instance, November 27, 1813, he writes, "Sotheby is a
<i>Litt&eacute;rateur</i>, the oracle of the Coteries of the *&nbsp;*'s, Lydia White
(Sydney Smith's 'Tory Virgin'), Mrs. Wilmot (she, at least, is a swan,
and might frequent a purer stream), Lady Beaumont and all the Blues,
with Lady Charlemont at their head." Again on December 1, "To-morrow
there is a party <i>purple</i> at the 'blue' Miss Berry's. Shall I go? um!&mdash;I
don't much affect your blue-bottles;&mdash;but one ought to be civil....
Perhaps that blue-winged Kashmirian butterfly of book-learning Lady
Charlemont will be there" (see <i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 333, 358, note 2).</p>

<p>Byron was, perhaps, a more willing guest at literary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span> entertainments
than he professed to be. "I met him," says Sir Walter Scott (<i>Memoirs of
the Life, etc.</i>, 1838, ii. 167), "frequently in society.... Some very
agreeable parties I can recollect, particularly one at Sir George
Beaumont's, where the amiable landlord had assembled some persons
distinguished for talent. Of these I need only mention the late Sir
Humphry Davy.... Mr. Richard Sharpe and Mr. Rogers were also present."</p>

<p>Again, Miss Berry, in her <i>Journal</i> (1866, in. 49) records, May 8, 1815,
that "Lord and Lady Byron persuaded me to go with them to Miss [Lydia]
White (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_587">p. 587</a>). Never have I seen a more imposing
convocation of ladies arranged in a circle than when we entered ... Lord
Byron brought me home. He stayed to supper." If he did not affect "your
blue-bottles," he was on intimate terms with Madame de Sta&euml;l, "the
<i>Begum</i> of Literature," as Moore called her; with the Contessa
d'Albrizzi (the De Sta&euml;l of Italy); with Mrs. Wilmot, the inspirer of
"She walks in beauty like the night;" with Mrs. Shelley; with Lady
Blessington. Moreover, to say nothing of his "mathematical wife," who
was as "blue as ether," the Countess Guiccioli could not only read and
"inwardly digest" <i>Corinna</i> (see letter to Moore, January 2, 1820), but
knew the <i>Divina Commedia</i> by heart, and was a critic as well as an
inspirer of her lover's poetry.</p>

<p>If it is difficult to assign a reason or occasion for the composition of
<i>The Blues</i>, it is a harder, perhaps an impossible, task to identify all
the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. Botherby, Lady Bluemount, and Miss Diddle are,
obviously, Sotheby, Lady Beaumont, and Lydia White. Scamp the Lecturer
may be Hazlitt, who had incurred Byron's displeasure by commenting on
his various and varying estimates of Napoleon (see <i>Lectures on the
English Poets</i>, 1818, p. 304, and <i>Don Juan</i>, Canto 1. stanza ii. line
7, note to Buonaparte). Inkel seems to be meant for Byron himself, and
Tracy, a friend, <i>not</i> a Lake poet, for Moore. Sir Richard and Lady
Bluebottle may possibly symbolize Lord and Lady Holland; and Miss Lilac
is, certainly, Miss Milbanke, the "Annabella" of Byron's courtship, not
the "moral Clytemnestra" of his marriage and separation.</p>

<p><i>The Blues</i> was published anonymously in the third number of the
<i>Liberal</i>, which appeared April 26, 1823. The "Eclogue" was not
attributed to Byron, and met with greater contempt than it deserved. In
the <i>Noctes Ambrosiance</i> (Blackwood's <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, May, 1823,
vol. xiii. p. 607), the third number of the <i>Liberal</i> is dismissed with
the remark, "The last Number contains not one <i>line</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span> of Byron's! Thank
God! he has seen his error, and kicked them out." Brief but contemptuous
notices appeared in the <i>Literary Chronicle</i>, April 26, and the
<i>Literary Gazette</i>, May 3, 1823; while a short-lived periodical, named
the <i>Literary Register</i> (May 3, quoted at length in <i>John Bull</i>, May 4,
1823), implies that the author (i.e. Leigh Hunt) would be better
qualified to "catch the manners" of Lisson Grove than of May Fair. It is
possible that this was the "last straw," and that the reception of <i>The
Blues</i> hastened Byron's determination to part company with the
profitless and ill-omened <i>Liberal</i>.

for the first time at Dunmore, in 1804. "I was not received here," he
tells Wordsworth, "with mere kindness; I was welcomed <i>almost</i> as you
welcomed me when first I visited you at Racedown" (<i>Letters of S. T.
Coleridge</i>, 1895, ii. 459). Scott (<i>Memoirs of the life, etc.</i>, 1838,
ii, II) describes Sir George Beaumont as "by far the most sensible and
pleasing man I ever knew, kind, too, in his nature, and generous and
gentle in society.... He was the great friend of Wordsworth, and
understood his poetry."]</p></div>

236), "was a personage of much social celebrity in her day. She was an
Irish lady of large fortune and considerable talent, noted for her
hospitality and dinners in all the capitals of Europe." She is mentioned
by Moore (<i>Memoirs</i>, 1853, in. 21), Miss Berry (<i>Journal</i>, 1866, ii.
484), Ticknor (<i>Life, Letters, and Journal</i>, 1876, i. 176), etc., etc.

Byron saw her for the last time in Venice, when she borrowed a copy of
<i>Lalla Rookh</i> (Letter to Moore, June 1, 1818, <i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 237).
Sir Walter Scott, who knew her well, records her death: "January 28,
[1827]. Heard of Miss White's death&mdash;she <i>was</i> a woman of wit, and had a
feeling and kind heart. Poor Lydia! I saw the Duke of York and her in
London, when Death, it seems, was brandishing his dart over them.
